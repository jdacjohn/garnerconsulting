<p><b>COBRA CHANGES INCLUDED IN HOUSE VERSION OF ECONOMIC STIMULUS</b></p>

<p align="justify">On January 28, 2009, the House of Representatives passed an economic stimulus package that includes
changes to COBRA and numerous other provisions that affect health care. The Senate is now debating the bill
and the provisions are likely to change by the time it goes to the President for signature. The COBRA
provisions in the version passed by the House include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 65% federal premium subsidy for up to 12 months for employees laid off between September 1,
2008 and December 31, 2009.</li>
<li>A provision that would allow employees who stop working at age 55 or older to keep COBRA
coverage until they become eligible for Medicare, regardless of how long the employee worked for
the employer.</li>
<li>A provision that would allow employees of any age who worked at least 10 years for an employer to
keep COBRA coverage until they become eligible for Medicare.
The mechanics of the premium subsidy would be as follows:</li>
<li>The employer, or an administrator designated by the employer, would collect the net premium (that
is, the 35% not paid by the subsidy).</li>
<li>The employer or administrator would remit the full premium to the insurer.</li>
<li>The employer would deduct the amount of the subsidies from its federal wage and tax deposit.</p>
</ul>

<p align="justify">Earlier in the week, the Senate Finance Committee passed its version of the economic stimulus package. That
bill would only provide the premium subsidy for up to 9 months and would retain the current 18-month limit
on COBRA for employees losing coverage due to termination of employment.
The bill that passed the House would also temporarily allow people receiving unemployment insurance to
obtain Medicaid coverage without the usual restrictions.</p>
<p align="justify">The House bill would encourage the adoption of health information technology. One way it would do so
would be by making payments of up to $65,000 to physicians who could demonstrate that they are using
electronic data in a meaningful way, such as by reporting quality measures. Hospitals would be eligible for up
to $2 million. Providers who do not adopt health information technology would face financial penalties,
starting in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>R&C AGREEMENT BETWEEN UNITED AND NY ATTORNEY GENERAL</strong></p>
<p align="justify">On January 13, 2009, UnitedHealth Group reached an agreement with New York’s attorney general, Andrew
Cuomo, regarding reasonable and customary (R&C) fees. Under the agreement, United will spin off its
Ingenix subsidiary’s databases, which are used by most insurers and claim administrators to determine R&C
fees for out-of-network providers. Separately, Aetna agreed to help fund a new system for determining R&C
fees.</p>

<p align="justify">United will turn over operations of the Ingenix databases to a nonprofit company that will contract with a
university to develop and operate an independent R&C database. Part of the agreement calls for establishing a
consumer web site that will disclose information about out-of-network pricing and provide health care
educational services that could encourage plan participants to become better consumers of health care.
United also agreed to pay $350 million to settle a lawsuit by patients and doctors that alleged underpayments.
Until the new database is operational, insurers and claim administrators can continue to use the Ingenix
databases.</p>
<p><strong>CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT RULES AGAINST BALANCE BILLING</strong></p>
<p align="justify">On January 8, 2009, the California Supreme Court unanimously ruled that emergency room physicians cannot
bill patients for amounts not paid by their HMOs. The court ruled that billing disputes over emergency
medical care must be resolved solely between the emergency room doctors, who are entitled to a reasonable
payment for their services and the HMO, which is obligated to make that payment. A patient who is a
member of an HMO may not be injected into the dispute. Emergency room doctors may not bill the patient
for the disputed amount.</p>
<p><strong>CORRECTION TO MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT EFFECTIVE DATE</strong></p>
<p align="justify">On December 23, 2008, the President signed a technical correction to the effective date of the amendments to
the Mental Health Parity Act that will affect some collectively bargained plans. The original language said
that plans maintained pursuant to collective bargaining agreements would not be subject to the new law until
the last of the collective bargaining agreements in place as of the date the President signed the bill in October
terminates (not counting extensions) and that in no event would a plan be required to comply prior to January
1, 2009. The technical correction in S. 3712 changes “2009” to “2010”. Plans not maintained pursuant to
collective bargaining agreements are not affected. The effective date remains the first day of the plan year
beginning on or after October 3, 2009 (which will be January 1, 2010 for calendar year plans).</p>
