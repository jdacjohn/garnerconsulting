<p><b>President Signs Bill Extending MHPA</b>

<p align="justify">Earlier this month, President Bush signed S. 1929, which extends the Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) through the end of 2004. The MHPA prohibits employer-sponsored group health plans from offering lower annual and lifetime dollar limits for mental disorders than for other medical conditions.

<p><b>IRS Provides Guidance On HSAs</b>

<p align="justify">Earlier this month, the Internal Revenue Service published Notice 2004-2 providing guidance on Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). An HSA is a tax-exempt trust or custodial account established exclusively for the purpose of paying qualified medical expenses of the account beneficiary who, for the months for which contributions are made to an HSA, is covered under a high deductible health plan (HDHP).

<p align="justify">Generally, an HDHP is a health plan that satisfies certain requirements with respect to deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses. Specifically, for self-only coverage, an HDHP has an annual deductible of at least $1,000 and annual out-of-pocket expenses (deductibles, co-payments and other amounts, but not premiums) not exceeding $5,000. For family coverage, an HDHP has an annual deductible of at least $2,000 and annual out-of-pocket expenses not exceeding $10,000. Unlike most group health plans that have both individual and family deductibles, an HDHP must impose the entire family deductible, even if only one person in the family has qualified medical expenses.

<p align="justify">No permission or authorization from the IRS is necessary to establish an HSA. An eligible employee may establish an HSA with or without involvement of the employer.

<p align="justify">Any insurance company or any bank or similar financial institution can be an HSA trustee or custodian. Additionally, any other person already approved by the IRS to be a trustee or custodian of IRAs or Archer MSAs can be approved to be an HSA trustee or custodian. Others may request approval.

<p align="justify">The HSA can be established through a qualified trustee or custodian who is different from the HDHP provider. Trustees and custodians can request proof that the beneficiary is eligible, such as whether the individual is covered by an HDHP.

<p align="justify">Any eligible individual may contribute to an HSA. Family members may make contributions to HSAs on behalf of other family members as long as the beneficiary is eligible.

<p align="justify">For 2004, the maximum contribution for an individual with self-only coverage is the lesser of the annual deductible under the HDHP (which must be at least $1,000) and $2,600. For family coverage, the maximum is the lesser of the annual deductible under the HDHP and $5,150. The annual limit is decreased by any contributions to an Archer MSA. Unlike Medical Savings Accounts, contributions to HSAs may be made even if the individual has no compensation.

<p align="justify">For individuals between the ages of 55 and 65, the HSA contribution limit is increased by $500 in 2004. This catch-up amount will increase in $100 increments annually until it reaches $1,000 in 2009.

<p align="justify">If both spouses have family coverage under separate plans, the lower deductible is the basis for determining the contribution limit, divided equally between them, unless they agree on a different division.

<p align="justify">Contributions can be made in one or more payments at any time prior to April 15<sup>th</sup> of the following year. Contributions to HSAs must be made in cash, not stock or other property.

<p align="justify">Earnings on amounts in HSAs are not includible in gross income.

<p align="justify">Medical expenses must be incurred after the HSA has been established. HSA trustees are not required to determine whether distributions are used for qualified medical expenses. Individuals with HSAs should maintain records of their medical expenses.

<p align="justify">Generally, health insurance premiums are not qualified medical expenses, except for: qualified long-term care insurance, COBRA continuation coverage, health care coverage while receiving unemployment compensation, Medicare premiums, including premiums for a Medicare HMO or retiree health insurance.

<p align="justify">Unlike Health Reimbursement Accounts, HSAs are not subject to COBRA.
