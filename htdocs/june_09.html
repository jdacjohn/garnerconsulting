	<p><b>IRS POSTS MORE Q&As ABOUT COBRA PREMIUM SUBSIDY</b></p>

	<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, commonly known as the "Economic
	Stimulus Package") created a COBRA premium subsidy whereby qualified beneficiaries who are
	involuntarily terminated between September 1, 2008 and December 31, 2009 (known as "Assistance
	Eligible Individuals" or AEIs) need to pay only 35% of the normal COBRA premium for a limited period
	of time. The employer pays the other 65% of the COBRA premium and is reimbursed for these costs in
	the form of a payroll tax credit.</p>
	<p>The IRS has updated the Q&As posted on its web site under the heading "COBRA: Answers for
	Employers."</p>
	<p>Answers to new questions under "Reporting and documentation" discuss the documentation needed by an
	insurer or multi-employer plan to establish that an employee is eligible for the premium assistance subsidy
	by reason of an involuntary termination of employment, confirm that the amount of the premium
	assistance subsidy need not be reported on an employees Form W-2 or Form 1099, and address who can
	claim the payroll tax credit in various situations involving employees of 2 or more unrelated employers,
	situations involving employers in a controlled group and situations involving employers who are agencies
	of a state government.</p>
	<p>The answer to a new question under "Form preparation" advises that if an agent is filing returns and
	making deposits and payments on behalf of an employer under a Form 2678, the employer would claim
	the payroll tax credit on any payroll tax return filed by the agent, and the agent should reduce any payroll
	tax deposits and payments made on behalf of the employer by the amount of the credit to which the
	employer is entitled.</p>
	<p>Answers to new questions under "Administration and eligibility" provide additional guidance on what
	constitutes an "involuntary termination of employment" under ARRA's COBRA provisions. Of interest
	is that the IRS will not challenge an employer's "reasonable interpretation" that is consistent with the
	applicable COBRA provisions in determining that employer is entitled to a payroll tax credit based upon
	the premium assistance afforded to a former employee.</p>
	Another answer notes that the premium assistance subsidy is not available under voluntary continuation
	coverage that an employer may provide if the employer is not subject to any COBRA continuation
	coverage requirements as required by ARRA. So, for example, a church plan that is exempt from federal
	COBRA requirements and is not covered under any comparable state law requirements would not be able
	to provide any premium assistance subsidy for former employees.</p>
	<p>Other new Q&As extend the definition of an "involuntary termination" of employment to seasonal
	workers hired for a limited period of time or to teachers hired under a one-year contract that is non-renewed,
	elected officials who are not re-elected or who are "termed out" under applicable term limitation
	requirements (but not elected officials who choose not to run for re-election), and members of a military
	Reserve Unit or the National Guard who are called to active duty. Other Q&As address eligibility for
	premium assistance under multiemployer plans in which employees may have "banked" hours prior to
	their involuntary termination of employment and in the case of an assistance-eligible individual eligible
	for or covered by Tricare, the length of time an assistance eligible individual may receive the premium
	assistance subsidy if he or she elects COBRA to be effective later than the first coverage period beginning
	on or after February 17, 2009, and clarify that COBRA premiums paid on a pretax basis from an
	individual's HRA are considered to be paid by the employer and hence not eligible for the premium
	assistance subsidy.</p>

	<p><b>HEALTH CARE REFORM PROGRESSING, BUT PACE MAY BE SLOWING</b></p>
	<p>Congress has held numerous hearings on health care reform, but a few key issues have emerged that have
	the potential to derail the process. One of the key issues is whether or not health care reform will include
	a public plan option. Advocates argue that it would provide more choice to consumers and keep costs
	affordable. Many doctors and hospitals are opposed to a public plan because they fear they would be
	underpaid, as they are now when they treat Medicare and Medicaid patients. Insurers are opposed to a
	public plan because they fear they could not possibly compete with a plan that could arbitrarily set
	payments to providers at artificially low levels. Opponents of a single-payer system are against a public
	plan because they fear that it would lead to a collapse of the private insurance market, leaving the public
	plan as a de facto single-payer plan. Efforts to reach a compromise on this issue have focused on either a
	weak public plan that would not set provider reimbursement rates as low as Medicare does or having the
	public plan as a fallback if the private insurance system fails to offer enough consumer choices at
	affordable levels.</p>
	<p>Other stumbling blocks to reform include the high cost of reform and how to pay for it and whether
	reform should include a requirement that all employers provide health insurance to their employees.</p>
