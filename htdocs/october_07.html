<strong>MISSOURI MANDATES SECTION 125 PLANS</strong>

<p align="justify">As a part of the "Missouri Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act" Missouri has mandated that employers that provide health insurance to their employees and that pay a portion of the employees' premiums must have a Section 125 Cafeteria plan in place by January 1, 2008.  Self-funded plans and employers that do not contribute to health premiums at all are exempt from this mandate. </p>

<p align="justify">At a minimum, employers who do not currently offer a Section 125 Cafeteria plan need to implement a Pre-Tax Premium Plan that allows employees the opportunity to pay their portion of their health premiums on a pre-tax basis.  They must put it in place and communicate the plan by January 1. </p>


<strong>ACTING CRAZY COUNTS AS FMLA NOTICE, 7TH CIRCUIT COURT RULES</strong>

<p align="justify">On October 17 the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against an employee who claimed that her employer had fired her unlawfully while she was on FMLA leave, and had not properly informed her of her FMLA rights.  However, the opinion also made clear that when an employee suffers a mental breakdown, as this employee did, unusual behavior is enough to "notify" the employer that the employee is in need of FMLA leave.  </p>

<p align="justify">In the opinion, Judge Diane Wood wrote that it was possible the employee didn't know she was suffering from a serious mental condition until she visited an emergency room and received a diagnosis.  Therefore, her strange behavior at work, including yelling at her superiors and acting violently, gave her employer "constructive notice" of her need for FMLA leave.  </p>

<p align="justify">The court did not uphold her claim that she was wrongfully terminated, however, because she failed to show that she was unable perform daily activities of her job.  </p>

<strong>DISTRICT COURT JUDGE WEIGHS IN ON SPOUSE COBRA NOTIFICATION</strong>

<p align="justify">On October 26, US District Judge Charles A. Shaw of the of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri ruled that a Missouri manufacturer failed to provide a former employee's wife with the required notice of her COBRA rights. </p>


<p align="justify">Though he found that Good Earth Tools, Inc. breached its responsibility to inform the plaintiff of her COBRA rights, Shaw declined to fine the employer. The court said there was no evidence of the company's bad faith.</p>


<p align="justify">The COBRA notice was not addressed jointly to the woman and her husband, who had worked for the company, and there was no special insert addressed to the wife of the former employee.</p>

<p align="justify">Shaw noted in the ruling that COBRA election rights must be provided to each qualified beneficiary, but admitted that courts had different holdings about how to notify a spouse of an employee whose employment terminates.</p>
