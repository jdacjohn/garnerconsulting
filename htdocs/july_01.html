<b>HHS Issues First Guidance On New Patient Privacy Protections</b>

<p>On July 6, 2001, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued the first in a series of guidance materials on new federal privacy protections for medical records and other personal health information. The guidance explains and clarifies key provisions of the medical privacy regulations, which were published last December.

<p>The guidance answers common questions about the new protections for consumers and requirements for doctors, hospitals, other providers, health plans and health insurers, and health care clearinghouses. It also clarifies some of the confusion regarding the meaning of key provisions of the rule. The changes primarily affect the operations of health care providers. For example, the guidance makes clear that hospitals do not have to build private, soundproof rooms to prevent overheard conversations about a patient's condition, as some mistakenly believed. Rather, the rule simply requires that hospitals provide reasonable safeguards to protect confidential information - such as using curtains, screens or similar barriers, which are often already used. The guidance also indicates that the rule allows a friend or relative to pick up a patient's prescription at the pharmacy, as often occurs today. The guidance clarifies that consent requirements will not restrict the ability of providers to consult with other providers about a patient's condition.

<p>Most covered entities have until April 14, 2003, to comply with the patient privacy rule; small health plans have an additional year to comply. HHS says that its Office for Civil Rights will conduct extensive outreach to consumers and healthcare providers to explain what the rule means for them. HHS also says it will provide technical assistance and further guidance to healthcare providers and other covered entities to help them comply.

<p>As permitted under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, HHS also expects to propose appropriate changes to the rule in order to ensure that it does not adversely affect patients' access to quality health care. For example, Secretary Thompson has said he intends to propose modifications to ensure that a pharmacist can fill a phoned-in prescription for a new patient, even when the pharmacist does not first have the patient's signed consent on file. HHS also says that it plans to change the regulations to permit providers receiving a patient referral for the first time to schedule appointments, surgery or other procedures before obtaining the patient's signed consent. HHS also says it will change the regulations to clarify that certain common practices, such as use of sign-up sheets,<br>X-ray lightboards and maintaining patient medical charts at bedside are not prohibited by the rule.

<p>The guidance only provides limited clarifications for plan sponsors. The guidance does clarify the following:
<ul type="square">

<li>Health plans are not required to obtain patient consent to use or disclose protected health information in order to carry out treatment, payment or related health care operations.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Plans may need a specific patient authorization to obtain medical information from treating physicians for coordination of benefits activities.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Health providers may disclose protected health information to health plans to obtain payment even if the patient has revoked consent.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>The "minimum necessary" provisions do not apply to uses or disclosures made pursuant to an authorization requested by the individual. For example, if a covered health care provider receives an individual's authorization to disclose medical information to a disability insurer for underwriting purposes, the provider is permitted to disclose the information requested on the authorization without determining the minimum necessary information.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>If a covered entity obtains a consent and also receives an authorization to disclose protected health information for treatment, payment or health care operations, the covered entity may disclose information only in accordance with the more restrictive document, unless the covered entity resolves the conflict with the individual. This means that the "most restrictive" standard only applies to disclosures for treatment, payment or health care operations. Therefore, other uses would not be subject to the "most restrictive" standard. For example, since a release for disability management purposes would not be considered a release for treatment, payment or health care operations, the "most restrictive" standard presumably does not apply.</li></ul>

<p><b>PWBA Extends Date For Health Plans To Comply With Claim Regulations</b>

<p>On July 9, 2001, the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration published a notice in the <i>Federal Register</i> deferring the deadline for group health plans to comply with the new claim regulations. Group health plans governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) must comply with the regulations by the first day of the first plan year beginning on or after July 1, 2002, but not later than January 1, 2003. Group disability plans and other employee benefit plans subject to ERISA still must comply for all claims filed on or after January 1, 2002.

<p><b>Court Says Prescription Contraceptives Must Be Covered</b>

<p>On June 12, 2001, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington ruled that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act requires a health plan to cover prescription contraceptives.
