<b>Democratic Takeover Of The Senate Portends Changes In Benefits</b> 

<p>On May 24, 2001, Senator James Jeffords of Vermont announced that he is leaving the Republican Party and will become an Independent. Even though he did not become a Democrat, he indicated he is aligning himself with the Democratic Party. Rather than having the Senate evenly divided with 50 Republican Senators and 50 Democratic Senators, with Republican Vice President Dick Chaney casting the tie-breaking vote, there will now be 50 Democrats, 49 Republicans and one Independent. With Jeffords supporting the Democrats, that gives the Democrats an effective 51-49 majority. That means that committee chairs will now be Democrats, rather than Republicans and the Democratic Party will control the scheduling of hearings and votes.

<p>Many Senators and Congressional Representatives have changed parties in the past, but never has a change resulted in a change in control of one of the Houses of Congress. These changes will have a significant impact on the political dynamics in the Capitol. One of the first areas to be affected may be the debate on a Patients' Bill of Rights.

<p>Interestingly, then-Republican Senator Jeffords joined with Senators Bill Frist (R-TN) and John Breaux (D-LA) on May 15, 2001 to introduce legislation that was intended to satisfy President Bush's stated requirements for a Patients' Bill of Rights that he would sign. This bill (S. 889), which was intended to be a balanced compromise, immediately met with criticism from those on both sides of the debate.

<p>S. 889 would provide a patient with a limited right to sue after the patient exhausted an appeals process with an external review panel. Suits would be allowed in federal, not state, courts; non-economic damages would be limited to $500,000 and punitive damages prohibited. By contrast, S. 283 sponsored by Senators Edward Kennedy (D-MA), John McCain (R-AZ) and John Edwards (D-NC), would allow awards of up to $5 million in federal court plus unlimited damages in state court.

<p>The American Medical Association and the American Trial Lawyers Association both support the Kennedy-McCain-Edwards bill. The insurance industry has opposed that bill, as well as the new Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, contending that both bills expose plans to too much liability. The argument is that increased liability will lead to increased costs, which will lead to an increase in the number of people without insurance.

<p>Senator Kennedy is likely to become chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee. As chair, he is likely to move his bill to the floor of the Senate for a vote soon after the Memorial Day recess. Most experts agree that there are over 50 Senators who would vote for this bill, but Republicans could filibuster. It takes 60 votes to cut off debate in the Senate and the Democrats may not be able to find that many votes.

<p>Representatives Greg Ganske (R-IA) and John Dingell (D-MI) have introduced the Kennedy-McCain-Edwards bill in the House. Even though the Republican Party continues to control the House, the House passed a bill in 1999 that was much more far reaching than what passed the Senate that year. Nothing ever became law because the House and Senate could not work out a compromise. The biggest area of disagreement was the issue of liability for health plans. It now appears that the Senate is poised to pass legislation that is very similar to what the House passed two years ago.

<p>President Bush has threatened to veto a bill with sweeping liability provisions, saying he wants a Patients' Bill of Rights, not a lawyer's right to bill. The President had said that none of the bills already in Congress were acceptable to him. Stay tuned - it should be an interesting summer.

<p>The change in Senate control will also affect the debate over Medicare reform and whether to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. Senator Max Baucus (D-MT) will probably become chair of the Senate Finance Committee. He is a strong proponent of an ambitious prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. He also worked closely with Republicans on the tax cut bill and may be anxious to dampen criticism from fellow Democrats by taking a more traditional Democratic position.

<p>President Bush campaigned for a Medicare drug benefit, but the White House has indicated that any Medicare drug benefit should be implemented as part of an overall Medicare restructuring. Senator Baucus and the rest of the Senate may push through a new drug benefit without any other Medicare reform. Bipartisan agreement will be difficult, but if a bill creating a new drug benefit passes the Senate, popular support could force the House to pass a similar measure and the President to sign it.

<p>The Democratic takeover in the Senate could prove to be a mixed blessing for the Democrats. When the Republicans controlled the White House and both Houses of Congress (however briefly) the pressure was on them to produce. Now that the Democrats control the Senate, they will be expected to produce something worthwhile. If there is gridlock in Washington, both parties will have to share the blame.
