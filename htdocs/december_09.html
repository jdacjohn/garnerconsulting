	<p><b>COBRA SUBSIDY EXTENDED</b></p>

	<p>On Saturday December 19, 2009, the President signed H.R. 3326, the Defense Department
	appropriations bill. The measure contains several key health-related provisions, including an
	extension of the federal subsidy of COBRA and state continuation benefits created last spring by the
	American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 (ARRA). The nine-month 65% subsidy of
	COBRA premiums is for involuntarily terminated workers and their dependents and is generally
	advanced by the employer, then reimbursed through a federal payroll tax credit. H.R. 3326 not only
	extends the length of the subsidy from nine months to 15 months, but it would also extend the last
	date for eligibility from December 31, 2009 to February 28, 2010. Unlike ARRA, which required
	federal agencies to issue regulations, this legislation does not include such a requirement. It is
	possible that that guidance may be issued.</p>
	<p><em>If you are subject to COBRA and are a client of Garner Insurance Services or a monthly retainer
	client of Garner Consulting, we will work with you to prepare the notices described below.
	Otherwise, feel free to contact us for assistance.</em></p>
	<p>In addition to the COBRA provisions, the defense bill also contained a two-month freeze on Medicare
	physician payment rates. If enacted, this provision of the bill would prevent a scheduled 21% cut in
	Medicare provider reimbursement rates from taking place on January 1, 2010.</p>



	<p><b>SENATE PASSES HEALTH CARE REFORM BILL</b></p>

	<p>Early in the morning on Christmas Eve, the Senate passed H.R. 3590, known as the Patient Protection
	and Affordable Care Act of 2009. When Congress returns in the new year, a conference committee
	will attempt to reconcile differences between the Senate version and the version that passed the House
	in November.</p>
	<p>One positive change in the version approved by the Senate is the indexing, for inflation, of a new
	$2,500 limit on health flexible spending accounts (an earlier version of the bill did not include
	indexing).</p>
	<p>Some of the key issues to be resolved during the conference discussions include the role of the states
	in the new exchanges that are being created; the structure of the exchanges; and the financing of the
	measure, in addition to the more high-profile issues of a government-run public plan and federal
	funding of abortion services.</p>

	<p>Other important provisions in the bill include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>A minimum loss ratio requirement (MLR) that applies to all fully insured plans, including
	grandfathered plans as of January 1, 2011, which may negatively impact coverage choice and
	affordability, especially during the transition time prior to 2014 when insurers will have all of
	the same expenses they have today, plus transition expenses. The MLR in this bill is now set
	at 85% for large-group plans and 80% for individual and small-group plans (100 and below).</li>
	<li>New annual health insurance premium taxes of over $6 billion per year to be enforced on
	2010 contracts that have already been priced and sold. In 2011, consumers will probably be
	hit with taxes for two years at one time.</li>
	<li>An individual mandate requirement with penalties so modest that it will make it more
	financially advantageous for many healthy Americans to forgo coverage until they are sick
	and then utilize the guaranteed-issue protections to obtain coverage.</li>
	<li>Strict modified community premium rating requirements (including age bands with a
	maximum differential of 3:1) that will apply to all fully insured plans under the latest version
	of the bill. This means all fully insured groups are required to abide by the modified
	community rating provisions, regardless of their size.</li>
	<li>The exchange structure proposed in the bill gives much authority to the secretary of Health
	and Human Services and may make the exchanges complex for consumers and costly for
	states to administer.</li>
	<li>New employee voucher provisions to allow choice between employer coverage and the
	exchange, but which could actually hurt participation in employer-based health insurance
	plans. These provisions will require employers to give vouchers to use in the individual
	market or exchange to certain lower-income employees who would normally be ineligible to
	purchase subsidized coverage through the exchange instead of participating in the employerprovided
	plan.</li>
	<li>An expansion of the federal Medicaid program to individuals up to 133% of the Federal
	Poverty Level. This will be financially crippling in the long run to our already struggling
	state governments, may displace millions of Americans from private coverage and further
	exacerbate the public program cost-shift to privately insured Americans.</li>
	<li>The creation of a new federal long-term care program that threatens the private long-term
	care insurance market and is inadequately financed.</li>
	<li>The 40% federal excise tax on high-cost health plans ($8,500 for individuals and $23,000 for
	families) is not indexed to medical inflation.</li>
	<li>Proposed cuts in funding for the Medicare Advantage program.</li>
	</ul>
