<b>MODEL COBRA NOTICES NOW AVAILABLE</b>
</p>


<p>The Department of Labor has posted the model notices that can be used in connection with the new COBRA subsidy. Employers will use 3 of the 4 notices and insurers will use the other one. One notice is designed for employees that the employer believes are entitled to the subsidy and who are not currently on COBRA. Another notice (called the abbreviated general notice) is for individuals who are currently on COBRA. Any other qualified beneficiary experiencing a qualifying event from September 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009 who has not already been sent an election form must be sent the full general notice. Employers must customize these notices and distribute them no later than April 18, 2009. 
	The model notices can be found at

	<b>ECONOMIC STIMULUS LAW EXPANDS HIPAA PRIVACY & SECURITY RULES</b>
	</p>
<p>	The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 signed into law by President Obama on February 17, 2009 significantly expands the application of HIPAAÕs privacy and security provisions.
</p>	
<p>	Among its provisions, the Act extends some privacy and security obligations directly to business associates, imposes new notification requirements following a breach of unsecured protected health information (PHI), adds disclosure requirements for electronic health records, and tightens enforcement and increases penalties for violations of the privacy and security rules. While many of the new provisions will become effective on February 17, 2010, other effective dates apply to certain provisions.
</p>	
<p>	The Act added new definitions for some key privacy and security terms, including "vendor of personal health records," "personal health record," "electronic health record," and "breach." 
	The Act also made a technical amendment to the HIPAA definition of "health plan" so that "health plan" now 
	includes Medicare Part D plans.
</p>	
<p>	The Act directly applies some of the privacy and security standards, including the civil and criminal penalties resulting from violations of the standards, to business associates in the same way that these standards and penalties apply to covered entities. As a result business associates will now be directly responsible for compliance under the privacy and security standards, instead of having their compliance mediated by a business associate contract.
</p>
<p>	Perhaps the most significant requirement for day-to-day operations is that business associates must notify
	 covered entities of a breach of unsecured PHI within 60 days of discovering the breach. Covered entities
	 in turn must notify affected individuals within 60 days of discovering or being made aware of the breach, 
	as well as giving notice to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and in some circumstances to
	 large media outlets. In addition a new notice requirement mandates that vendors of personal health records and
	others who may not be covered entities or business associates notify affected individuals as well as the 
	Federal Trade Commission of such a breach. The FTC will issue appropriate regulations.</p>

<p>	Under the Act new reporting requirements apply to a covered entity's disclosures of PHI made from an electronic health record. Under these standards, an individual has a right to receive an accounting of such disclosures made either by a covered entity or its business associate during the previous three years, including disclosures made for treatment, payment, and health care operations (TPO). Prior to the Act, covered entities were not required to provide an accounting of disclosure made for TPO purposes. For covered entities that currently use electronic health records, this new requirement takes effect January 1, 2014. For covered entities that do not yet utilize electronic health records, the new requirement will take effect the later of January 1, 2011 or the date covered entity begins using electronic health records.
</p>
<p>	The Act also directs HHS to issue guidance on what constitutes the "minimum necessary" in connection with the use, disclosure, or request of PHI no later than August 17, 2010. Until then the Act requires covered entities and business associates to limit the use, disclosure, or request for PHI from another covered entity to a limited data set if practicable or, if needed, to the minimum PHI necessary to accomplish the intended purpose.
</p>
<p>	Effective as of February 17, 2009 the Act increases civil monetary penalties for violations of the privacy and security standards from $100 per violation to $1,000 or more per violation. The Act also clarifies that employees of a covered entity who wrongfully obtain or disclose PHI maintained by the covered entity can be subject to criminal penalties. By way of enforcement, the Act authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions in federal district courts against individuals who violate these standards. Finally the Act requires HHS to conduct periodic audits of covered entities and business associates to ensure that they are complying with these rules.

<p>	<strong>9th CIRCUIT COURT REFUSES TO REVIEW SAN FRANCISCO MANDATE</strong></p>

<p>On March 9, 2009, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals announced that it would not review a decision by a three-judge panel that upheld the San Francisco law mandating that employers spend a minimum amount of money on health care for employees. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pre-empts state and local laws that relate to employee benefits. On January 10, 2008, a three-judge panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the right of the City of San Francisco to implement its new health care mandate. Overturning a District Court finding that the mandate portion of the Healthy San Francisco health care plan violated federal law, the court stated that the law does not require employers to establish ERISA plans or make changes to ERISA plans, and therefore the law is not pre-empted by ERISA.
</p>
<p>News reports indicate that the Golden Gate Restaurant Association intends to appeal to the United States Supreme Court. Because the 4th Circuit ruled that a Maryland law mandating that certain employers spend a minimum amount of money on health care was pre-empted by ERISA, it is likely that the Supreme Court will review the decision to resolve the conflict between the circuits.
</p>
<p>Judge William Fletcher wrote 
	"Nothing in the ordinance requires the employer to establish an ERISA plan, 
	and nothing in the ordinance interferes in any way with the uniformity of ERISA regulations. 
	Writing in dissent, Judge Milan D. Smith, Jr. said the decision will "undoubtedly 
	serve as a road map in jurisdictions across the country on how to design and enact a 
	labyrinth of laws requiring employer compliance on health care expenditures, thereby 
	creating the very kind of health care expenditure balkanization ERISA was designed to avoid".
</p>
<p>The San Francisco Health Care Security Ordinance requires employers to demonstrate that they spend at least $1.85 per hour on employee health care for employees working in San Francisco or make payments to the city. The ordinance applied to employers with 50 or more employees effective January 1, 2008. For employers with 20 to 49 employees, the ordinance was effective April 1, 2008. Smaller employers and nonprofits with fewer than 50 employees are exempt.
