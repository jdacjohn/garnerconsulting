	<p><b>DOL POSTS APPEAL FORM FOR COBRA PREMIUM REDUCTION DENIAL</b></p>
	<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, commonly known as the "Economic
	Stimulus Package") created a COBRA premium subsidy whereby certain qualified beneficiaries known as
	"Assistance Eligible Individuals" or AEIs may pay only 35% of the normal COBRA premium for a
	limited period of time. The employer would pay the other 65% of the COBRA premium and be
	reimbursed for these costs in the form of a payroll tax credit.</p>
	<p>The Department of Labor (DOL) has posted on its web site the application form a qualified beneficiary
	may complete to request an expedited review by the DOL of the AEI's denied request by a former
	employer for the reduced COBRA premium. The "Application to the U.S. Department of Labor for
	Expedited Review of Denial of COBRA Premium Reduction" is 5 pages long, not including an overview
	of ARRA's premium reduction provisions, a check list the applicant may use to validate their potential
	eligibility for the premium reduction, and three pages of detailed instructions on completing the
	application form. The instructions provide examples of the kinds of documents that the applicant may
	wish to include with the application to document their status as an AEI and their eligibility for the
	reduced COBRA premium. The instructions also note that in reaching a determination, the DOL may
	share information with the applicant's former employer or plan administrator.</p>
	<p>The application form is available at <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/COBRA/main.html" target="_blank">http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/COBRA/main.html</a> and is for use only
	by AEIs covered under private-sector group health plans. AEIs covered under group health plans
	sponsored by federal, state or local governments, and AEIs covered under a state's "mini-COBRA" law
	(where the group health plan is not subject to the federal COBRA requirements) should contact the CMSsponsored
	premium assistance continuation coverage help desk toll-free at (866) 400-6689 or via e-mail
	at <a href="mailto:continuationcoverage@maximus.co">continuationcoverage@maximus.com</a>. CMS anticipates posting their equivalent application on
	their web site soon.</p>
	<p>
	The DOL's web page also includes a link to a form the AEI may complete to submit additional
	documents for review if the application for review has been previously submitted. The AEI may
	complete the DOL application for expedited review online, or the application can be printed and
	submitted by mail.</p>



	<p><b>CAL-COBRA AMENDED TO CONFORM TO ARRA</b></p>
	<p>On May 12, 2009, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed AB 23, which amends
	California's health benefits continuation coverage laws, known as Cal-COBRA, to conform to the
	premium subsidy provisions in the ARRA. This new law takes effect immediately. Cal-COBRA applies
	to group health insurance and HMO policies written in California for plans sponsored by employers with
	fewer than 20 employees.</p>
	<p>AB 23 amends Cal-COBRA to require insurers and HMOs to send written notices to qualified
	beneficiaries who had or will have a qualifying event between September 1, 2008 and December 31,
	2009. The notices must include a description of ARRA's COBRA subsidy provisions and explain who is
	eligible for the subsidy, the amount of premium the person will pay and how long a person has to elect
	coverage. Enrollment materials must be included for those who have not yet elected coverage.
	For those who have a qualifying event after May 12, 2009, the notice must be provided within 14 days of
	receiving a notice of a qualifying event.</p>
	<p>AB 23 also creates for people covered by plans subject to Cal-COBRA, a second election period similar
	to that in ARRA. Individuals who did not previously elect Cal-COBRA or who elected it and dropped it
	and who otherwise qualify as an AEI, have 60 days from the date of the notice to elect continuation
	coverage.</p>
	<p>Qualifying beneficiaries requesting premium assistance may submit a written document or other
	information to verify that they were involuntarily terminated. The insurer or HMO must accept this
	information as sufficient unless a reasonable and timely determination is made that the information is
	legally insufficient to establish involuntary termination of employment.</p>
	<p>An insurer or HMO may request verification of involuntary termination from the former employer. The
	request must be mailed or faxed within 7 business days of the request for premium assistance and the
	employer has 10 calendar days from receipt to respond in writing. If the insurer or HMO cannot verify
	involuntary termination on a timely basis, either the premium subsidy must be granted or the insurer or
	HMO must send a denial letter explaining the right to appeal under ARRA.</p>






	<p><b>HEALTH CARE REFORM ON FAST TRACK</b></p>
	<p>
		On April 29, 2009 (the 100th day of President Obama's Administration) Congress passed a budget that
		lays out some basic principles for health care reform: making health care coverage affordable,
		guaranteeing Americans a choice of health plans and physicians, investing in prevention and wellness,
		improving patient safety and quality care, and making health care reform fiscally sustainable. Democrats
		inserted a parliamentary measure that will allow health care reform to be passed by a simple majority in
		the Senate, avoiding a possible filibuster.</p>
		<p>Congressional leaders have committed to passing a comprehensive health care reform bill by July 31.
		Details are still being worked out and in all likelihood, there will be differences between House and
		Senate versions that will need to be resolved after the August recess, even if both houses can meet the
		July 31 deadline.</p>

	<p><b>SAN FRANCISCO INCREASES HEALTH CARE SPENDING REQUIREMENT</b></p>
	<p>
		On April 22, officials from the City and County of San Francisco announced that health care spending
		requirements will increase in 2010. Effective next year, employers with 100 or more employees will be
		required to spend at least $1.96 per hour per covered employee on health care, up from $1.85 in 2009.
		Employers with at least 20 employees, but less than 100, will need to spend at least $1.31 per hour, up
		from $1.23. Employers with less than 20 employees will continue to be exempt from the health care
		spending requirement.</p>
	<p>	Earlier this year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to review a three-judge panel's decision
		that the health care spending ordinance was not pre-empted by the Employee Retirement Income Security
		Act. The Golden Gate Restaurant Association has indicated that it intends to ask the U.S. Supreme Court
		to review that ruling.</p>
