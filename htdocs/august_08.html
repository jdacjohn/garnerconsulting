<p><strong>SENATE TAKES UP ADA AMENDMENTS ACT</strong></p>

<p align="justify">When the U.S. Senate returns from its August recess, it will take up S. 3406, the ADA
Amendments Act (ADAAA), introduced by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA). With 64 co-sponsors, it
appears virtually certain that this legislation is headed for passage by the Democratic-controlled
Senate and eventual signature by President Bush, whose father signed the landmark Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990.</p> 

<p align="justify">The ADAAA is the first major re-visit of the original ADA, which disability advocates say has
been narrowed too far from Congress’ original intent due to a series of appellate and Supreme
Court decisions. If the ADAAA is passed, employers will again have to review and possibly
upgrade their Human Resources programs to ensure compliance with requirements for
interviewing, hiring, training, accommodating and promoting persons with disabilities.</p>

<p align="justify">The ADAAA is a compromise version of the “ADA Restoration Act” first proposed by the
disability advocate community. This bill was considered in committee which has recommended
it be considered by the Senate as a whole. Although it has been placed on a calendar of business,
the order in which bills are considered and voted on is determined by the majority party
leadership.</p>

<p align="justify">It is hard to predict the pace of action in the Senate. If disability advocates or employers push
for aggressive changes to the language in the Senate bill, this could impede progress. Electionyear
politics could also impact or affect progress.</p>

<p><strong>MENTAL HEALTH PARITY MOVING SLOWLY</strong></p>

<p align="justify">When Congress returns from its August recess, a conference committee will also be taking up
mental health parity legislation. Legislation that re-authorizes current mental health parity laws
has already been passed. In addition, both the House and Senate have passed new laws creating
a higher standard and broader scope of mental health parity. A joint conference committee has
negotiated an informal agreement for a single version of expanded parity. The next step is to
pass a final version of the bill, and that process is running into delays. A final version of the
expanded parity legislation may be attached to another bill.</p>

<p align="justify">
The parity provisions already passed by each house would require group health plans to provide
the same coverage for mental disorders as for other medical conditions. That’s a big change from
current law, which bars discriminatory annual and lifetime dollar limits on mental health care
coverage but allows discrimination in other ways, such as letting plans pay only 50% of mental
 health care expenses, while they cover, for example, 80% of expenses for treatment of other
medical problems.

<p><strong>REPORT INDICATES SUCCESS WITH MASSACHUSETTS HEALTH REFORM</strong></p>



<p align="justify"><em>Health Care in Massachusetts: Key Indicators</em> is a quarterly report from the Division of Health
Care Finance and Policy. In their report released in August, the Division found that since the
implementation of health reform over 439,000 additional people have obtained health insurance.
Nearly half of that growth (191,000) has been in private group coverage (i.e., through
employers) or individual purchase.</p>  



<p align="justify">Nearly three-quarters of Massachusetts employers offer health insurance to their employees.
The rate of Massachusetts employers offering insurance has held steady, even as the rate
declined nationally from 68% to 60% between 2001 and 2007, as reported in a survey by the
Kaiser Family Foundation.</p> 


<p align="justify">The increase in the number of people with insurance appears to be the cause of a substantial drop
in patients seeking routine care in hospital emergency rooms, which is saving the state millions
of dollars.</p>


<p><strong>CENSUS BUREAU REPORTS NUMBER OF UNINSURED FELL IN 2007</strong></p>

<p align="justify">According to a press release, a decline of 1 million uninsured was the first annual decline since
the Bush administration took office. The Census Bureau said 45.7 million people (15.3% of the
population) were uninsured in 2007 - down 3% from 47 million in 2006. The number of people
with health insurance increased to 253.4 million in 2007, compared to 249.8 million in 2006.</p>

<p align="justify">The percentage of people covered by employment-based health insurance decreased to 59.3% in
2007 from 59.7% in 2006. The number of people covered by employment-based health insurance
(177.4 million) was not statistically different from 2006.</P>

<p align="justify">The number of people covered by private health insurance (202 million) did not change
appreciably from 2006, according to the press release; however, the number of people covered
by government health insurance increased to 83 million, compared to 80.3 million in 2006.</P>

<p align="justify">Using a three-year average for 2005 through 2007, Texas had the highest percentage of
uninsured at 24.4%. At 8.3%, Massachusetts and Hawaii had the lowest rates of uninsured, but
they were not statistically different from Minnesota (8.5%), Wisconsin (8.8%) and Iowa (9.4%).
In addition, Hawaii was not statistically different from Maine (9.5%).</P>

<p align="justify">According to the Census Bureau report, the proportion of people not covered by health insurance
is lower among people with higher income. In 2007, 24.5% of people in households with annual
incomes of less than $25,000 had no health insurance coverage.</P>
