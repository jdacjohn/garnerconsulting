<strong>ERISA Pre-Empts Maryland Health Care Law, Says Judge</strong>

<p align="justify">On July 19, a Federal Judge, Frederick J. Motz (known for his “silliness test” in his last ruling regarding the legislation) ruled that the matters with which the Maryland law deals are already more properly handled in the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).</p>

<p align="justify">“The act violates ERISA’s fundamental purpose of permitting multi-state employers to maintain nationwide health and welfare plans, providing uniform nationwide benefits and permitting uniform national administration.”</p>

<p align="justify">Wal-Mart, the employer which was obviously the target of this legislation, praised the ruling and noted that it now provides health care for children of part-time employees, as well as having reduced the waiting time for part-time workers to qualify for insurance. A spokesperson stated that the company is trying to offer more affordable health care to its employees.</p>

<p><strong>Chicago Passes Ordinance on Wages and Benefits For Big Box Stores</strong></p>

<p align="justify">An ordinance passed the Chicago City Council on July 26 which requires retailers with at least 90,000 square feet in a single location to pay wages of at least $10 per hour and offer benefits worth at least $3 per hour by 2010. To be phased in gradually starting in July 2007, the mandate differs from the approximately 140 other living-wage ordinances in that it targets only large retailers and includes a benefits requirement.</p>

<p align="justify">Wal-Mart issued a statement that the ordinance “imposes special interest mandates” and “sends a message that Chicago is closed for business.” The Illinois Retail Merchants Association (IRMA) and the Washington-based Retail Industry Leaders Association are both waiting to see whether Chicago’s Mayor Richard Daley will veto the ordinance before filing any lawsuits. Daley has until the next City Council meeting, on September 13, to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Massachusetts Issues Health Care Reform Regulations</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On August 11, Massachusetts Senator Richard T. Moore, chairman of the Joint Committee on Health Care, declared that he does not agree with proposed regulations released in late June. The regulations clarify an aspect of the act that allowed the state to asses a $295 fine per employee to employers who do not provide a “fair and reasonable” contribution to health care premiums. The regulations specify two tests to determine whether an employer is making fair and reasonable contributions. First, if at least 25% of full-time employees are enrolled in the group health insurance plan, then the employer would pass. The test allows employers to exclude part-time employees and temporary employees. Alternatively, employers who offer to pay at least 33% of health care premiums would pass the test.</p>

<p align="justify">Moore says that the median premium contribution in Massachusetts is 75% and anything less than 50% should not be considered a “fair share.” Stating that the new regulations are “pushing the envelope,” Moore announced that he is considering using the Senate’s version of a technical correction bill to introduce a higher standard to the law. If that effort is foiled by a veto, he will introduce a new law when the Legislature reconvenes in January.</p>

<p><strong>US Senate Passes Law Allowing Canadian Drugs To Cross Borders</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On July 11, the Senate passed a law that creates a loophole excluding Canada from the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) ban on importation of prescription drugs into the US. As a part of the Homeland Security Department spending bill, the measure was passed after a long debate surrounding the issue on whether drugs made outside the US would be safe. Proponents state that the measure could help to slow the rapid increase in prescription costs in the country. The new law will bar Customs and Border protection officers from stopping people who have physicians’ prescriptions for FDA-approved drugs from bringing them into the US from Canada.</p>

<p align="justify">Some states have already been bucking the system and allowing Canadian drugs across the border, which has begged the question of whether the power to regulate prescription drug commerce lies with states or the federal government.</p>

<p><strong>Pension Reform Legislation Passes, Missing Key Goals</strong></p>

<p align="justify">Since H.R. 2830 got bogged down in a conference committee between the House and the Senate, the House recently passed a revised pension reform bill known as H.R. 4. The Senate also passed the bill late in the day on August 3. This bill is very similar to H.R. 2830, but unfortunately it does not contain two provisions the employee benefits professionals have been looking for: Flexible Spending Account (FSA) rollovers and the inclusion of long-term care insurance (LTC) in Section 125 cafeteria plans. The new law does include language that drops tax barriers to creating new combinations of LTC, life insurance and annuities. It also allows the cash value of a life insurance policy or annuity to be used to pay for LTC benefits without penalty.</p>

<p><strong>HSA Comparability Rules Published</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On July 28, the Treasury Department and the Internal revenue Service (IRS) released final regulations on HSA comparability. The new regulations allow plan sponsors to:</p> 

<ul type="square">
<li>use additional HSA contributions to motivate employees to participate in health risk assessments and disease management programs,</li> 
<li>make different contributions for groups of employees that are subject to collective bargaining,</li> 
<li>make different comparable contributions based on different variations of family coverage.</li></ul>  

<p align="justify">Also included is a clarification of the exclusion for employer contributions made through cafeteria plans. If an employee were to make contributions to an HSA through salary reductions in a cafeteria plan, all employer contributions would be treated as being made through the cafeteria plan, and would therefore be exempt from the comparability rules.</p>

<p><strong>Aetna Acted Arbitrarily, Says Court</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On July 11, the US 6<sup>th</sup> District Court of Appeals ruled that Aetna Life Insurance acted arbitrarily when it terminated disability benefits for a participant without considering whether he could find a job at 80% of his previous income. Although Aetna had paid for the participant to get a college education, the plan stated that an employee is disabled if he or she cannot work at a reasonable occupation and earn at least 80% of his or her previous income. Since the participant was unable to secure such a job even after graduating from college, the court ruled that Aetna was wrong for terminating his disability benefits.</p>
