<b>California Governor Signs Play-Or-Pay Bill</b>

<p align="justify">On October 5, 2003, California Governor Gray Davis signed SB 2. This bill creates a State Health Purchasing Program. This bill requires employers to provide health benefits (play) or pay a fee to the Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board (MRMIB), which would provide health benefits.

<p align="justify">The bill requires large employers (200 or more employees) to pay 80% of both employee and dependent premiums beginning January 1, 2006. Employers with 50 through 199 employees will be required to pay 80% of employee premiums beginning January 1, 2007. Employers with 20 through 49 employees will not be required to pay or play until the legislature approves a subsidy. Employers with less than 20 employees are exempt. For more details about the bill see our <a href="september_03.html" target="_blank">September Bulletin</a>.

<p><b>CMS Says HIPAA EDI Rules Do Not Apply To Debit Cards</b>

<p align="justify">On October 6, 2003, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) posted answers to questions on its web site that clarify that the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) rules on electronic data interchange (EDI) do not apply to debit cards or credit cards used in conjunction with a flexible spending account (FSA) or health reimbursement arrangement (HRA). One answer states:

<p style="padding-left:40; padding-right:40" align="justify">A beneficiary’s use of an FSA’s or HRA’s debit or credit card for payment of out-of-pocket expenses at a pharmacy or provider’s office, that routinely accepts traditional credit card payments is comparable to any payment to a health care provider using a conventional credit card. Debit and credit card transmission for these transactions are not subject to the HIPAA EDI requirements, and are considered transactions between the beneficiary and a provider, not a health plan and a provider.

<p align="justify">This position is good news for employers that sponsor FSAs or HRAs that provide participants with a debit or credit card. Hopefully, the IRS will adopt the same logic with regard to Form 1099.

<p align="justify">When the IRS released Revenue Ruling 2003-43 in May, it gave its blessing to the use of debit cards and credit cards when appropriate procedures are followed. Unfortunately, the IRS also surprised the benefits community by saying that payments to providers made through a debit or credit card must be reported on a Form 1099. Debit and credit cards are not typically set up to capture the data needed to file a Form 1099. If the IRS adopts the same logic as the CMS (and they have stated they are studying the issue), it would remove the 1099 requirement for debit and credit cards used in FSAs and HRAs.

<p><b>Senate Approves Genetic Discrimination Bill</b>

<p align="justify">On October 14, 2003, the United States Senate unanimously approved a bill banning discrimination based on genetic factors. The bill would prohibit employers from using genetic information in hiring, firing or compensation decisions. The bill would also bar insurance companies from using genetics to set premiums or deny coverage. Businesses generally would not be allowed to gather genetic information, except to monitor the impact of potential workplace hazards.
 
<p align="justify">Critics claim the bill is not necessary. It is unlikely that the bill will pass the House this year.

<p><b>IRS Releases 2004 Plan Limits</b>

<p align="justify">On October 16, 2003, the IRS released 2004 indexed amounts for a variety of plans. The changes include:

<ul type="square">
<li>Part B Medicare Premiums will increase 13.5% to $66.60 from $58.70.</li>

<li>The Part A Medicare deductible will increase to $876 from $840.</li>

<li>The definition of highly compensated employee remains at $90,000.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">In a separate announcement, the IRS increased the mileage rate to 37.5 cents per mile, up from 36 cents in 2003.

<p><b>CMS Announces HIPAA EDI Contingency Plan</b>

<p align="justify">On September 23, 2003, the CMS announced that it would implement a contingency plan to accept noncompliant electronic transactions after the October 16, 2003 compliance deadline. Without this contingency plan, Medicare would have stopped paying thousands of providers. This may indicate that CMS will deal leniently with health plans that are unable to comply with the electronic data interchange rules.
