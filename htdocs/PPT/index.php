			<h2>We Are Responsive</h2>
			
			<p>Large consulting companies have multiple levels of responsibility 
			and capability. This makes it difficult to respond rapidly to client 
			problems. Our company, in contrast, is relatively small, but 
			highly action oriented. With us, you access one level of 
			management: our upper echelon.</p>
			
			<h2>You Work With Our Best</h2>
			
			<p>The consultants assigned to your account have documented 
			expertise in your area of immediate concern. They are much more 
			than well qualified technicians. They have actually performed 
			and, in most instances, managed the activities on which they 
			are consulting.

			<p>We promise you the best people. We deliver what we promise.</p></p>
			
			
			<h2>We Know We Work For You</h2>
			
			<p>Our company's ongoing prosperity has always come from 
			providing innovative consultation, which produces immediate, 
			bottom line results and long term value. So, our interests are 
			identical to our clients' - period.

			<p>Moreover, our recommended solutions are in no way related to 
			self-serving, unstated sales objectives. Client value, with 
			satisfaction guaranteed, is our only "reason for being" as a 
			business.</p></p>

				<h3>Wage & Hour Division Interprets "in Loco Parentis" Status</h3>
				
			<p>	Blog By: John Garner</p>
				
<p>On June 22, 2010, the Administrator of the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division
	 published an Interpretation regarding the definition of a son or daughter under the 
	Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) as it applies to an employee standing "in loco parentis" to a child. 
	 The Wage and Hour Division issued the interpretation in response to several requests for additional 
	guidance regarding whether employees who do not have a biological or legal relationship with a child
	 may take FMLA leave for birth, bonding, and to care for the child.</p>
