<b>Washington Watch</b>

<p align="justify">There have been a number of benefit-related developments in Washington, D.C. The Bush Administration is proposing a number of changes to benefit laws, most of which are included in President's proposed budget. Proposed Administration changes include:

<ul type="square">
<li>Making Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) permanent and available to all employees, not just those with small employers. The proposal would also allow high-deductible health insurance policies sold in conjunction with MSAs to cover preventive services with no deductible.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Allowing employees to roll over up to $500 a year from Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs). FSA amounts could be rolled over to the following year, to an MSA or to a 401(k) plan. The proposal also would allow the money to be taken as cash, which would be taxable. This proposal would overturn the "use-it-or-lose regulation" issued by the Internal Revenue Service.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Allowing the creation of Association Health Plans (AHPs). This proposal would allow industry associations and other groups formed for purposes other than health insurance to purchase health insurance as a group.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Offering tax credits to low-income and middle-income people who purchase individual health insurance, if they do not have employer-subsidized insurance. Tax credits would also be available to displaced employees who are eligible for unemployment insurance.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Making long-term care insurance premiums fully tax deductible. The proposal would also give caregivers an additional tax exemption.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Making prescription drug coverage available to all Medicare beneficiaries. It would take several years to implement the program and the Administration proposes a temporary plan to give senior citizens discounts on drugs.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">The Bush Administration continues to support a Patients' Bill of Rights that is similar to the House-passed version. There have been rumors that the President and Senator Kennedy (D-MA) have been discussing a deal on a Patients' Bill of Rights.

<p align="justify">Senator Kennedy outlined a number of benefit-related proposals in a speech in January. Reports indicated that he proposed:

<ul type="square">
<li>Requiring all employers with more than 100 employees to provide basic health insurance to their employees. According to the Senator, this would cover about one-third of the uninsured.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to apply to all employers with at least 25 employees. Currently FMLA applies to employers with 50 or more employees.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Expanding health insurance benefits for part-time employees. The Senator did not provide details, but said he would advocate for health coverage for part-time employees. He pointed out that only 17% of part-time employees have health insurance, compared to 73% of full-time employees.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">A trade assistance bill (S. 1209) was approved by the Senate Finance Committee in February. The bill includes a provision calling for the federal government to pay 75% of COBRA premiums for employees who lose their jobs because of foreign competition. The bill is now headed for the Senate floor. If the Senate passes the bill with this language, it will have to be reconciled in a conference committee, because the House version does not contain a comparable provision.

<p align="justify">On February 14, 2002, the House passed the Economic Security Worker Assistance Bill. The bill includes tax credits for displaced employees who purchase health insurance. It includes funding for high risk pools.

<p><b>BenefitsAlliance Now Available</b>

<p align="justify">Garner Consulting and Garner Insurance Services (the insurance brokerage division of Garner Consulting) are pleased to announce that they are now among a select number of brokers and consultants offering BenefitsAlliance. BenefitsAlliance is an employee benefits purchasing alliance designed for California-based businesses with 50 to 5,000 employees.
