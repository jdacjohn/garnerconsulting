	<p><b>HEALTH CARE REFORM MISSES DEADLINE</b></p>

	<p>President Obama had set a deadline for Congress to pass health care reform legislation in each house
	before the August recess. Even though Congressional committees have approved different versions of
	health care reform legislation, no bill has been acted upon by either the House or Senate. The Senate does
	not begin its recess until after the first week of August, but Senate leaders have made it clear that no bill
	will reach the Senate floor before recess. Members of Congress will use the recess to receive input from
	constituents on the key issues.</p>

	<p>The Senate Finance Committee is likely to be the only committee that will pass a truly bipartisan bill.
	Several members of the committee - three Democrats and three Republicans - have been meeting
	privately to discuss health care reform and are likely to produce a bill that differs substantially from what
	other committees have passed. Reports indicate that it is likely that the Finance Committee will approve
	non-profit health care co-ops as a way to inject more competition into the system, rather than the more
	controversial public plan option passed by other committees. Reports also indicate that the Finance
	Committee is unlikely to approve an employer mandate to provide health benefits, which has been a part
	of bills approved by other committees; however, they may require employers that do not offer coverage to
	pay the cost of any government subsidies given to their employees. To pay for health care reform, reports
	indicate that the Finance Committee will probably not impose taxes on high-income individuals and,
	instead, will propose a tax on rich health benefit plans (possibly as much as 35%) and may restrict the tax
	benefits of Health Savings Accounts. As a way to control increasing health care costs, the Finance
	Committee is reportedly considering creating a commission charged with slowing the growth of Medicare
	costs, whose recommendations would be subject to Congressional veto.</p>

	<p>Because the President has indicated that he would rather sign a bill with bipartisan support that does not
	include everything that he wants than sign a bill with everything that he wants that has only Democratic
	backing, the Senate Finance Committee version of reform is more likely to be closer to the final product
	than the bills that have passed other committees in the House and Senate. The President's two main
	priorities are expanding coverage to the uninsured and lowering the rate of health care inflation and it
	appears that the Senate Finance Committee bill under discussion will meet those criteria. Even though
	the Senate Finance Committee appears to be the only hope of bipartisanship, there is a possibility that a
	bill that could gather support from conservative Democrats and any Republicans might be too
	conservative for liberal Democrats, who might combine with most Republicans to defeat it.
	Reports indicate that there appears to be a substantial amount of common ground between the Senate
	Finance Committee's discussions and bills passed by other committees, including expanding access to
	Medicaid for lower income people, providing subsidies to low income people who do not qualify for
	Medicaid, creating so-called "exchanges" to make comparison shopping easier and cutting the growth in
	Medicare spending.</p>

	<p>The insurance industry has offered to do away with pre-existing conditions exclusions and recissions of
	coverage if health care reform legislation includes a requirement that virtually all individuals purchase
	health insurance and this combination of provisions also appears to be part of all the bills now progressing
	through Congress. Furthermore, there appears to be consensus that insurers would have to accept all
	applicants and could not charge higher premiums because of a person's gender, medical history or a
	current illness. It also appears likely that all insurers would have to offer a standard minimum package of
	benefits to be defined by the federal government.</p>

	<p>Reports indicate that the Senate Finance Committee has also been discussing how to create payment
	incentives for doctors and other health care providers to work in collaborative teams as part of so-called
	"accountable care organizations". There has been a lot of talk in Congress about rewarding high quality
	care by paying for the value of care, rather than the volume of services. Reports also indicate that the
	Finance Committee has been discussing preventive medicine and the need to encourage Americans to
	lead healthier lives. It is possible that co-payments may be eliminated for preventive services.</p>

	<p>One way to pay for increased coverage that is being discussed is to eliminate flexible spending accounts
	or to place a maximum, such as $2,000, on them (currently dependent care spending accounts are subject
	to a $5,000 annual maximum, but there is no limit on health care accounts). A provision included in at
	least some of the bills passed by committees would provide an exception to the ERISA preemption
	provision that would allow states to experiment with single-payer plans. Another possibility is that the
	COBRA subsidy enacted earlier this year will be extended.</p>

	<p>It appears that the most contentious issues Congress will face are whether to have a public option, how to
	pay for expanded coverage and how much, if anything, employers will be required to pay.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Garner Consulting encourages everyone to make their views known on all of these important subjects.</em></strong></p>


	<p><b>CMS LAUNCHES WEB SITE TO ASSIST EMPLOYEES WITH ARRA</b></p>
	<p>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) launched a new web site in mid-July to assist
	unemployed workers in requesting expedited appeals of a denial of COBRA premium assistance
	eligibility by their former employers. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA,
	commonly known as the "Economic Stimulus Package") created a COBRA premium subsidy that allows
	qualified beneficiaries who are involuntarily terminated between September 1, 2008 and December 31,
	2009 to pay only 35% of the normal COBRA premium for up to nine months. The former employer pays
	the other 65% of the COBRA premium and is reimbursed for these costs in the form of a payroll tax
	credit.</p>
	<p>CMS chose MAXIMUS Federal Services, Inc. to administer the expedited appeals process, make
	recommendations to CMS regarding the eligibility of individuals for the COBRA premium subsidy, and
	to answer questions from individuals about the COBRA premium subsidy program and the expedited
	review process.</p>
	<p>The new web site contains helpful information about the COBRA premium assistance subsidy created by
	ARRA including links to the DOL, HHS and IRS sites for additional information about COBRA and the
	premium subsidy as well as links to Q&As on other agency web sites and a link to the form for a worker
	to complete to request an expedited review of a denial of eligibility for the premium subsidy.
	The new CMS web site can be found at <a href="http://www.ContinuationCoverage.net" target="_blank">www.ContinuationCoverage.net</a>. A toll-free helpline is
	available at 1-866-400-6689 (TTY: 1-866-631-5610) between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Eastern time.</p>
