<b>Tax Bill Includes Provisions That Affect Welfare Plans</b> 

<p>On June 7, 2001, President Bush signed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA). Most of the benefit-related news associated with the tax bill has centered on increases in 401(k) limits and other provisions related to retirement plans. This bulletin will focus on some of the less publicized provisions that relate to welfare plans.

<p><i>Dependent Care Spending Accounts</i>

<p>In what may have been a drafting error, Congress has made it much more difficult for employers to satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements for dependent care spending accounts. In the past, the dependent care tax credit was more advantageous than salary reduction for most employees earning less than about $24,000 annually. Accordingly, employees earning less than $25,000 a year could be excluded from the calculations in determining whether a dependent care spending account satisfied the nondiscrimination rules. Beginning in 2002, EGTRRA increased the dependent care tax credit from $2,400 to $3,000 if there is one qualifying individual and from $4,800 to $6,000 if there are two or more qualifying individuals. EGTRRA also increased the maximum credit from 30% to 35%. The phase-down of the credit begins at $15,000 of adjusted gross income, rather than $10,000. These changes will make the dependent care tax credit more attractive than salary reduction for many employees earning over $25,000, but EGTRRA did not increase the $25,000 limit on earnings for excluding employees from the dependent care spending account nondiscrimination tests. This will make it more difficult for plans to pass the nondiscrimination tests. The $5,000 maximum for employer-provided dependent care or salary reduction was not increased.

<p><i>Adoption Credits</i>

<p>EGTRRA extends and expands the tax credit for adoption. Most of the provisions apply beginning in 2002. Adoption can be an employee benefit on a salary-reduction basis or an employer-provided basis. A maximum credit of $10,000 per eligible child will apply to all children, including special needs children. Beginning in 2003, the tax exclusion for special needs children will no longer be limited to the expenses related to the adoption. The tax credit phases out for people with modified adjusted gross income of $150,000 or more and is completely phased out at $190,000. The adoption credit is made "permanent".

<p><i>Employer-Provided Child Care Facilities</i>

<p>Beginning in 2002, employers will receive a tax credit equal to 25% of qualified expenses for employee child care and 10% of qualified expenses for child care resource and referral services. The maximum total credit cannot exceed $150,000 annually.

<p><i>Educational Assistance</i>

<p>Section 127 educational assistance plans have been made "permanent" and extended to graduate education for courses beginning in 2002.

<p><i>Key Employees</i>

<p>EGTRRA changed the definition of key employee. This definition is used in nondiscrimination testing for both retirement and welfare plans. For plan years beginning in 2002 and later, a key employee is:
<ul type="square">
<li>An officer with compensation in excess of $130,000 (adjusted for inflation),</li>

<li>A 5% owner, or</li>

<li>A 1% owner with compensation in excess of $150,000.</li></ul>

<p>An employee will now be considered a key employee based on the prior year, rather than a four-year lookback period. These changes will make it easier to pass the top-heavy rules for retirement plans and for group-term life insurance and cafeteria plans to pass nondiscrimination tests. These changes will also affect funding limits for postretirement life and medical benefits.

<p><i>Compensation Limit</i>

<p>For years beginning in 2002 or later, the annual compensation that may be taken into account in determining benefits under a Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association (VEBA, also known as a 501(c)(9) trust) is increased from $170,000 to $200,000. The cap does not apply to group-term life insurance that must meet the Internal Revenue Code Section 79 nondiscrimination requirements. This change will affect a small number of disability benefit plans.

<p><i>Sunset Provision</i>

<p>EGTRRA has a sunset provision at the end of 2010 and all changes to the tax code, including so-called "permanent" changes will cease to apply.
