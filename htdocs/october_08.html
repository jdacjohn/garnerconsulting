	<b>MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ARRIVES AS PART OF FINANCIAL BAILOUT</b>
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	When Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act on Oct. 3, it included a new higher
	standard for mental health parity in employer health plans. The new standard, based on the Paul Wellstone
	and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, will take effect for most calendar
	year plans beginning January 1, 2010.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	The new standard requires the following from a group health plan providing medical/surgical benefits and
	mental health or substance use disorder benefits:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li> Financial requirements such as deductibles and copayments for mental health or substance use
	disorder benefits are no more restrictive than the predominant financial requirements applied to
	substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan;
	<li> No separate cost-sharing requirements apply only to mental health or substance use disorder benefits;
	<li> Treatment limitations for mental health or substance use disorder benefits are no more restrictive than
	the predominant treatment limitations applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits
	covered by the plan; and
	<li> No separate treatment limitations apply only to mental health or substance use disorder benefits.
	</ul>
	<p align="justify">
	This version of mental health parity is much more comprehensive than the current Mental Health Parity Act,
	which only prohibits annual and lifetime limits on mental health treatment. Many common plan provisions
	will no longer be allowed, including:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li> Limiting the number of days of inpatient care covered by the plan
	<li> Limiting the number of outpatient visits covered by the plan
	<li> Paying a lower benefit for mental health services than for medical and surgical services, such as 50%
	for mental health and 80% for medical and surgical.
	</ul>
	<p align="justify">
	Last year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated a similar bill would increase health insurance premiums
	by an average of about 0.2%. Employers may disagree with that assessment, and can seek exemption from the
	new parity standard under provisions similar to a seldom-used exemption under the Mental Health Parity Act
	that has been in place for years. The provisions require a six-month waiting period before applying for
	exemption, actual cost of coverage increases by more than 2% in the first year and more than 1% each
	following year, and certification of the increases by a qualified, licensed actuary.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<i>No rejections without explanation</i>: the new law requires plan administrators to list their criteria for
	medical necessity determinations as part of their reason for any denial of reimbursement or benefit related
	to mental health or substance use disorder services.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<i>Out-of-network provisions</i>: The law also requires plans to provide out-of network coverage for mental health
	or substance use disorder benefits if they cover medical or surgical benefits provided by out-of network
	providers.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	The new rules will be effective January 1, 2010, for most calendar-year plans. Plans maintained pursuant
	to collective bargaining agreements will not be subject to the new law until the last of the collective
	bargaining agreements terminates (not counting extensions); <u><b>in no event will the plan be required to
	comply prior to January 1, 2009</b></u>.
	</p>
	<p >
	<b>LAW CONTINUES HEALTH COVERAGE FOR ILL COLLEGE STUDENTS</b>
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	"Michelle's Law," which prohibits group health plans from terminating coverage for college students who are
	too ill to maintain full-time student status, will require calendar-year plans to comply by January 1, 2010.
	Coverage for students can be terminated after one year of medically necessary leave or sooner if the terms of
	the plan would otherwise terminate coverage (such as if the child marries).
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	The extended coverage only applies if the plan receives a written certification by a treating physician stating
	the child suffers from a serious illness or injury, and the leave of absence or other change in enrollment is
	medically necessary. Group health plans must include a description of Michelle's Law rights with any notice
	regarding certification of student status, a notice that is an annual routine for many plans.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	Children affected by this new law are entitled to the same benefits as if they were not on a medically necessary
	leave of absence.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	President Bush signed H.R. 2851 on October 9. It was dubbed "Michelle's Law" in deference to Michelle
	Morse of New Hampshire, a college student who lost her battle with colon cancer in 2005. This new law
	applies to both fully insured and self-funded group health plans and to government plans, as well as plans
	governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The new law applies to plan years
	beginning October 9, 2009 and later, which means that calendar-year plans need to comply effective January
	1, 2010.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>APPEALS COURT SAYS HEALTH MANDATE IS NOT PRE-EMPTED BY ERISA</b>
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	On September 30, 2008, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that San Francisco's health care spending
	mandate is not pre-empted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The Golden Gate
	Restaurant Association has filed a petition seeking a rehearing by the full court. San Francisco's mandate,
	which went into effect January 1, 2008, employers in the city must contribute to health care coverage to avoid
	fines.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	On the surface, it appears that the 9th Circuit's decision conflicts with the 4th Circuit's decision in the case of
	Maryland's Wal-Mart bill. If the full court upholds the unanimous decision of the three-judge panel, the
	conflict between the circuits could prompt a review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Even if the Supreme Court
	decides to take the case, it would probably be a year or two before they render a decision. In the meantime,
	employers in San Francisco will need to comply with the ordinance.
