<p><b>U. S. Supreme Court Rules ADEA Does Not Protect Young “Old”</b>

<p align="justify">On February 24, 2004, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) does not prevent employers from favoring older employees over younger ones, even when the younger ones are over age 40. The case is General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline et al. (No. 02-1080)

<p align="justify">In this case, a collective bargaining agreement eliminated the company’s obligation to provide health benefits to future retirees, except for current employees who were at least 50 years old. The ADEA protects employees age 40 and over and a group of employees between ages 40 and 50 sued, alleging the agreement violated the ADEA because it discriminated against them based on their age.

<p align="justify">The U. S. Supreme Court held that the ADEA’s text, structure, purpose, history and relationship to other federal statues show that the statute does not mean to stop an employer from favoring an older employee over a younger one.

<p><b>Fed Chairman Supports Medicare Cuts</b>

<p align="justify">On February 25, 2004, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan proposed that the government scale back Medicare and Social Security benefits, rather than increase taxes in order to fight the growing deficit. Testifying before the House Budget Committee, Mr. Greenspan said that raising taxes by enough to solve the deficit problem would pose “significant risks” to economic growth.

<p align="justify">Among other things, Mr. Greenspan suggested increasing the Medicare eligibility age to 67 and linking it to increases in life expectancy. He also suggested modifying the way Social Security benefits are increased to reflect inflation to reduce the amount of the increase each year.

<p><b>HIPAA Standard Provider Identifier Finalized</b>

<p align="justify">On January 23, 2004, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published rules adopting a standard unique identifier for health care providers, as required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). The rules adopt CMS’ National Provider Identifier (NPI) as the standard unique health identifier that group health plans and other covered entities under HIPAA must use when engaging in standard electronic transactions.

<p align="justify">The NPI will be issued through the National Provider System that CMS has under development. The NPI will replace all “legacy” identifiers that are currently in use. According to CMS, the use of the NPI will reduce costs and improve efficiency by eliminating the need for providers to keep track of multiple identification numbers assigned by various health plans.

<p align="justify">All health care providers covered by HIPAA (those who engage in electronic transactions) must obtain an NPI. The application process will not begin until May 23, 2005. Use of the NPI will be required by May of 2007 (2008 for small health plans). NPIs will be 10-digit, all–numeric identifiers.

<p align="justify">CMS plans to propose an identifier for health plans later this year; rules for standard identifiers for employers were published in 2002. The final rule on provider identifiers includes an amendment to the employer identifier rules clarifying that the IRS Employer Identification Number adopted by CMS may be used for “any other lawful purpose” in addition to standard transactions under HIPAA.

<p><b>GASB Re-Releases Proposed Rules On Retiree Welfare Benefits</b>

<p align="justify">In January 2004, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) re-released its proposed rules that require recognition of liability for postemployment benefits in financial statements when a benefit is earned, rather than when it is paid. Changing from pay-as-you-go accounting to accrual accounting will have a significant impact on many state and local governments’ financial statements.

<p align="justify">The biggest change from the original exposure draft had to do with the so-called “implicit rate subsidy” that occurs when a plan uses the same rates for both active employees and retirees without Medicare. Previously, if a plan used such a rate structure and retirees paid the full amount, the GASB valuation did not need to recognize the value of the subsidy. This position has been reversed due to comments from the actuarial community. GASB’s revised rules are now consistent with comparable accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that apply to private sector firms.

<p align="justify">The proposed effective dates will be phased in based on the governmental entity’s annual revenues, with the largest ($100 million or more) effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and the smallest (under $10 million) effective two years later.

<p align="justify">Under GASB’s proposed rules, plans with over 200 members will be required to conduct biennial actuarial valuations. GASB’s final rule is expected to be released in June 2004.
