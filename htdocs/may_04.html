<p><b>DOL Publishes Final COBRA Notice Regulation</b>

<p align="justify">On May 26, 2004, the Department of Labor (DOL) issued final regulations (29 CFR Part 2590) that make significant changes to the COBRA notice requirements. These final regulations:

<ol>

<li>Require the general COBRA notice (called the “initial notice” in earlier regulations) to be provided to covered employees and covered spouses within 90 days after coverage under a group plan begins; the regulations specify the content of the general notice;</li>

<li>Require that employers provide plan administrators notice of certain qualifying events (death, termination of employment, reduction in hours, or Medicare entitlement) usually within 30 days; the regulations describe the content of such notices;</li>

<li>Define rules governing when and how plan administrators can require covered employees and qualified beneficiaries to provide notice of certain qualifying events and the consequences that plan administrators may impose for failure to provide these notices within the specified time limits;</li>

<li>Require plan administrators to provide the COBRA election notice within 14 days after receiving notice of a qualifying event; the regulations specify 15 provisions the election notice must contain;</li>

<li>Require plan administrators to provide a notice of unavailability of COBRA continuation coverage (usually within 14 days) if, after receiving notice of a qualifying event, the plan administrator determines that the individual is not entitled to COBRA continuation coverage; the regulations specify the contents of this notice; and</li>

<li>Require plan administrators to provide qualified beneficiaries who are receiving COBRA continuation coverage a written notice of any termination of their COBRA coverage that is earlier than the applicable maximum coverage period.</li>
</ol>

<p align="justify">These final regulation’s notice requirements will be effective as of the first day of the first plan year that begins on or after November 26, 2004. Calendar year plans must comply beginning January 1, 2005.

<p align="justify">The regulations identify an exception to the requirement that the general notice be provided to the employee and covered spouse within 90 days of the commencement of their coverage under a group health plan. The exception is when the employer would also be required to provide an election notice to a qualified beneficiary during the initial 90-day period, due to the occurrence of a qualifying event. The DOL reviewed comments that questioned the need for a general notice in this situation, and concluded that furnishing a general notice and an election notice simultaneously during the initial 90-day period would be duplicative, if not confusing and distracting. The regulations therefore allow that, where an individual is required to be furnished an election notice within the 90-day period for furnishing the general notice, the plan administrator may satisfy its notice obligation by furnishing an election notice (but not the general notice) in accordance with the regulations.

<p align="justify">According to the DOL, while the use of the model notices published with the regulations is not mandatory, “[t]he furnishing of appropriately and accurately completed model notices, however, will be considered by the Department [of Labor] to constitute compliance with the requirements of the applicable notice regulations.”

<p align="justify">The model general notice in the 2004 final regulations is different from the version proposed by the DOL in its 2003 proposed regulations in several respects. First, plan-specific information may be placed at the end of the general notice, in order to minimize the difficulty of customizing the document. Second, the DOL eliminated the requirement that the general notice identify both the plan administrator and the COBRA administrator. As finalized, the general notice requires only the name, address and telephone number of the party or parties who will provide information about the plan and COBRA upon request. Third, the DOL eliminated the requirement that the general notice describe how qualified beneficiaries who are receiving continuation coverage must provide notice to the plan administrator of a second qualifying event. This information is included as part of the model election notice required under the final regulations. Eliminating this information from the general notice but retaining it in the election notice will ensure that this information is furnished when it will be more relevant to the qualified beneficiary. Fourth, the DOL eliminated references in the general notice to COBRA coverage beginning dates, since different qualifying events may yield different dates. In making this change, however, the DOL noted that nothing in the final regulations precludes a plan administrator from including such information in a plan’s general notice. The DOL also made a number of editorial changes to improve the clarity of the model general notice.

<p align="justify">The final regulations identify the start date of the 60-day employee/beneficiary notice period as the latest of (1) the date of the qualifying event, (2) the date on which coverage would be lost as a result of the qualifying event, or (3) the date on which the qualified beneficiary is informed through the plan’s SPD or the general notice, of his or her obligation to provide notice and the procedures for providing such notice.
