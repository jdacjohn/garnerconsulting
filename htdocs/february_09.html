<p><b>SCHIP BILL BRINGS NEW EMPLOYER RESPONSIBILITIES</b></p>

<p align="justify">On February 4, 2009, President Obama signed H.R. 2, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009. This bill includes new responsibilities for employers sponsoring group health plans.</p>



<p align="justify">The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) is a joint federal and state program that provides health insurance to children in families that earn more than the limits for Medicaid. States set up and run the programs with federal funding. H.R. 2 will expand the number of children covered from about 7 million to approximately 11 million. When George W. Bush was President, he vetoed a number of bills that would have expanded SCHIP coverage.
</p>

<p align="justify">Currently, a few states pay a portion of the health insurance premiums under employer-sponsored plans, if that is more cost-effective than covering the children under the SCHIP plan. H.R. 2 expands these programs. This will allow children to remain in, or become covered by, employer-sponsored plans, rather than obtaining coverage directly through SCHIP plans.
</p>

<p align="justify">H.R. 2 amends the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Public Health Service Act to create a new category of special enrollment rights. Group health plans will have to permit eligible employees and/or their dependents who are not enrolled to enroll if the employee or dependent loses coverage under Medicaid or SCHIP or becomes eligible for premium assistance under Medicaid or SCHIP. Unlike other special enrollment periods, which last for 30 days after the triggering event, these new special enrollment periods last for 60 days.
</p>

<p align="justify">H.R. 2 also creates two new notice requirements. Employers that maintain group health plans in states that provide premium assistance will have to provide each employee a written notice informing the employee of potential opportunities for premium assistance available in the state in which the employee resides. The new law requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop national and state-specific model notices.
</p>

<p align="justify">Plan administrators will also be required to disclose to a state, upon request, information about the benefits available under the group health plan to allow the state to determine if it would be more cost-effective to provide premium assistance or to cover the individual directly. The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Labor are to appoint a working group to develop a model coverage coordination disclosure form.
</p>


<p><strong>ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE INCLUDES HEALTH-RELATED PROVISIONS</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package. The act includes a number of provisions related to health care.
</p>
<p align="justify">The act appropriates $21.4 billion for premium subsidies for COBRA continuation coverage for unemployed workers. This money will provide a 65% subsidy of premiums for up to 9 months for eligible workers. It will be administered through a mechanism that allows employers (or health plans if they administer COBRA benefits) to receive a credit against payroll taxes. Individuals with annual incomes above $125,000 (single) or $250,000 (couples) are not eligible for the subsidy. Plan sponsors do not need to worry about enforcing these limits because any excess subsidies will be recovered via individual income tax returns.
</p>
<p align="justify">To be eligible for the premium subsidy, an employee must be involuntarily terminated between September 1, 2008 and December 31, 2009. The subsidy is not retroactive. The subsidy begins March 1, 2009.
</p>
<p align="justify">The subsidy applies to state health care continuation laws, as well as federal COBRA. It does not apply to flexible spending accounts. The subsidy applies to premiums for dependent coverage, in addition to employee-only coverage. If a plan sponsor allows someone on COBRA to change to a less expensive plan, the subsidy will apply to the less expensive plan.
</p>
<p align="justify">The individual must pay and the plan must collect 35% of the premium before applying for the subsidy. The employer will need to advance the 65%, and then recover the subsidy by taking a credit on its payroll taxes. If the subsidy exceeds the taxes due, the employer or plan will need to handle the situation in the same way as if it had overpaid its taxes.
</p>
<p align="justify">Because it will be difficult for plan sponsors to implement these provisions as early as March and April, the act includes transition provisions that allow employers who receive full premiums from assistance-eligible continuees to refund the subsidy or use it as a credit against future premiums.
</p>
<p align="justify">The subsidy will be difficult for multiemployer plans to recover because they are not responsible for income taxes and FICA payments. On the other hand, many multiemployer plans base coverage on an hour bank and union members do not usually lose coverage due to termination, but due to a reduction in hours. Therefore, many union members covered by multiemployer plans will not be eligible for the subsidy.
</p>
<p align="justify">The subsidy will end when an individual is offered other group coverage or becomes eligible for Medicare. These rules are different than the rules for terminating COBRA coverage, which require that the individual actually become covered by another group health plan or Medicare.
</p>
<p align="justify">The federal agencies responsible for administering COBRA have 30 days to release new model notices that reflect the subsidy. Plan sponsors will have 60 days from the date the act was signed to distribute the notices. Qualified beneficiaries who had not already elected COBRA will have another 60-day election period. Coverage does not need to be retroactive. The new coverage can be effective March 1, 2009, but there may be a gap in coverage that could mean that pre-existing conditions exclusions might apply in the future.
</p>
<p align="justify">The act also appropriates $19 billion for the adoption and use of health information technology. Included among these provisions are ones that:
</p>

<ul>
	
<li>Codify the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONCHIT) and establish an open and transparent process led by the National Coordinator to develop standards by 2010 that allow for secure nationwide electronic exchange of health information.
</li>
<li>Provide $2 billion in immediate funding for health information technology infrastructure, training, dissemination of best practices, telemedicine, inclusion of health information technology in clinical education, and state grants to promote health information technology.
</li>
<li>Expand current federal privacy and security protections for health information such as requiring that an individual be notified if there is an unauthorized disclosure or use of their health information and requiring a patient's permission to use their personal health information for marketing purposes.
</li>
<li>Invest in the adoption and use of health IT, such as electronic health records by providers who serve Medicare and Medicaid patients.
</li>
<li>Provide temporary bonus payments ranging from $44,000 to $64,000 for physicians and up to $11 million for hospitals that meaningfully use electronic health records.
</li>
<li>Phase-in Medicare payment penalties for those physicians and hospitals not using electronic health records starting in 2014.
</li>
</ul>
