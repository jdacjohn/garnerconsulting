<p><strong>SUPREME COURT REBUFFS AARP ON RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS </strong></p>

<p align="justify">On March 24, 2008, the Supreme Court declined to review a 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruling which upheld the authority of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to issue regulations permitting employers to coordinate retiree health benefits with Medicare or similar state programs (AARP v. EEOC, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 12869).  The Court thereby rebuffed the AARP's challenge to the EEOC and in effect affirmed the Appeals Court's finding that under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) the EEOC can allow employer-sponsored health plans to coordinate retirement health benefits with Medicare without thereby violating the ADEA's prohibitions against age-based discrimination.  This bodes well for employer-sponsored retiree health plans that are seeking ways to continue to provide retiree health benefits at affordable costs.  Had the AARP prevailed, many employer-sponsored plans would likely have reduced early retirees' benefits to the level provided to older retirees, or eliminated retiree benefit plans altogether.</p> 

<p align="justify">AARP had challenged the EEOC on several fronts, including challenging the EEOC's authority under the ADEA to issue an exemption to the Act as well as the validity of the proposed exemption under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  The Appeals Court examined and rejected each of AARP's challenges.  The Court found, for example, that the ADEA "clearly and unambiguously" granted the EEOC the authority to provide, at the least, narrow exemptions from the ADEA's prohibitions, and that the EEOC's proposed exemption (which would permit coordination of retiree health benefits with Medicare) was a "reasonable, necessary and proper" exercise of its authority since the effect of the exemption would be to encourage employers to provide some level of retiree health benefits rather than reducing or eliminating them altogether.  The Court also rejected the AARP's contention that the proposed exemption was arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion and hence in violation of the APA.  The Court noted that because the EEOC had shown the proposed exemption to be reasonable, necessary and proper under the terms of the statute the EEOC had in fact exercised due regard for the purposes of the ADEA according to its own regulatory requirements.  The Court further opined that a change in policy supported by a reasoned analysis for the change is not arbitrary and capricious and that the EEOC's proposed exemption was "supported by its full consideration of the relevant factors, potential effects and possible alternatives to such a policy."  </p>

<p align="justify">The Supreme Court's refusal to consider the issue on appeal signals for at least the time being, that employers can reduce health care benefits for retirees when they become eligible for Medicare or similar state programs without exposing themselves to costly and protracted litigation.  Practically this means that employers can create a two-tiered retiree health plan that provides richer benefits to younger retirees while reducing (by coordinating) benefits with Medicare for older retirees.</p>

<p><strong>HOUSE PASSES EXPANSIVE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY BILL</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On March 5, 2008, the House of Representatives passed the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007.  This bill would significantly expand the scope of the Mental Health Parity Act approved by Congress in 1996.  The original law prohibits lifetime and annual limits on mental health treatment.  The new bill would require plans that cover mental health to provide the same level of benefits for both mental health and substance abuse treatment that are provided for medical and surgical treatment.  As with the original law, the new bill only applies to employers with more than 50 employees.  The Senate passed a similar bill several months ago and now a conference committee must work out the differences between the two bills.</p>

<p align="justify">The House bill is sponsored by Jim Ramstad (R-MN) and Patrick Kennedy (D-RI).  Ramstad is Patrick Kennedy's Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor.  Patrick Kennedy's father, Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), is one of the driving forces behind the Senate version of the bill.</p>

<p align="justify">One of the biggest differences between the two bills is that the House bill requires coverage of any condition listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association.  The DSM includes such things as caffeine addiction and jet lag.  Many insurers have objected to this provision claiming it would drive up costs unnecessarily.</p>  


<p><strong>MEDICARE TRUSTEES' REPORT SHOWS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE</strong></p>



<p align="justify">Each year the Trustees of the Medicare trust fund report in detail on its financial condition.  The 2008 report indicates no significant change.  The Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund will be exhausted in 2019, the same as was projected last year.  The Trustees believe that the HI Trust Fund will pay out more in benefits than it receives in taxes and other dedicated revenues this year.</p>  



<p align="justify">The next President will not be able to avoid dealing with the issue and the report may lead to pressure on the Presidential candidates to state their positions during the campaign.  While the candidates have talked about health care reform generally, they have mostly avoided discussing Medicare.</p> 


<p align="justify">There is a separate Trust Fund for Part B of Medicare.  While the Trustees expect steep increases in Part B costs, that Trust Fund will not run out of money because it has access to general revenue.  Additionally, premiums are usually adjusted each year to cover about 25% of the expected costs of Part B.</p>
