<b>Mental Health Parity High On Congressional Agenda</b>

<p>The Mental Health Parity Act is scheduled to sunset on September 30, 2001. Indications are that Congress will act shortly after it reconvenes following the August recess to extend and expand the rules on mental health parity. The current law only prohibits annual or lifetime dollar limits. In early August, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee unanimously approved S. 543, which would require full mental health parity for plans that offer mental health coverage. This bill would prohibit plans from imposing limits on hospital stays or physician visits for mental health treatment that are greater than those imposed for physical health. The bill would also require the same co-payments and deductibles for mental health as for other medical services. Plans could use separate networks for mental health. Small employers (50 employees or fewer) would be exempt.

<p><b>Patient Protection Bill Passes House After Deal With President</b>

<p>On August 2, 2001, the House of Representatives passed a controversial patients' bill of rights after a key sponsor of the bill, Rep. Charles Norwood (R-GA), agreed to changes that would make it acceptable to President Bush. The bill has many similarities with the bill passed by the Senate on June 29, 2001. There is no guarantee that a conference committee will be able to resolve the differences between the two versions. Two years ago, both Houses of Congress passed similar legislation, but the conference committee could not reach a compromise. Two years ago, the Republican-controlled Senate passed the more conservative version of the bill. This year, the Democratic-controlled Senate passed the more liberal version of the bill.

<p>The key sticking point in reaching a compromise is likely to be the provision related to damages. Both the House and Senate versions allow unlimited economic damages, but the similarities end there. The Senate version also allows unlimited damages for pain and suffering, whereas the House bill caps noneconomic damages at $1.5 million. The Senate bill limits punitive damages to $5 million. The House bill caps punitive damages at $1.5 million and only allows them if a plan fails to comply with an external review decision. Perhaps most importantly, the Senate bill allows damages to the extent permitted by state law, which means punitive damages would be unlimited in many states. Under the House bill, states are allowed to apply lower damage limits, but not higher limits.

<p>A difference of one small word makes a big difference in the potential damages under the two bills. Under the Senate version, a health plan can be sued for damages if its failure to exercise ordinary care in making a health benefits decision is "a" proximate cause of injury or death. Under the House bill, for a patient to sue, the plan's decision would have to be "the" proximate cause of injury or death.

<p>There are a number of provisions that are basically the same in each bill, including:

<ul type="square">
<li>If a plan does not have a specialist who is available or appropriate to treat a patient, the plan must provide access to a non-network specialist at no extra cost to the patient.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Patients could go to the closest emergency room at the same cost as a preferred facility if a prudent layperson would determine that emergency care was needed.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Plans would be required to allow the substitution of a nonformulary prescription drug at the cost of a formulary drug, if the alternative drug is deemed medically necessary by the treating physician.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Plans would have to provide patients the right to coverage of routine costs in clinical trials funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, the Veterans Administration or the Food and Drug Administration.</li></ul>

<p>The House bill includes a number of provisions intended to improve access to health benefits that are not included in the Senate bill. The House version does a number of things, including:

<ul type="square">
<li>Expands Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). Among other things, the provision would lower the minimum MSA deductibles, allow employers of any size to offer MSAs, allow individuals to create MSAs, allow contributions to MSAs to equal up to all of the deductible, repeal the limit on the number of MSAs and allow MSAs to be part of cafeteria plans.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Speeds up full deductibility of health insurance premiums for the self-employed.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Provides a tax credit for small employers that provide health insurance.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Allows association health plans to help small businesses form health insurance pools.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Allows the Department of Health and Human Services to award demonstration grants to study market innovations that increase access to health insurance.</li></ul>
