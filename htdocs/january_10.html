	<p><b>DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELEASES MODEL COBRA NOTICES</b></p>

	<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), as amended by the Department
	of Defense Appropriation Act, 2010 (2010 DOD Act), mandates that plans notify certain current
	and former participants and beneficiaries about the COBRA premium reduction and the extension
	of the eligibility period to qualify for the reduction. The Department of Labor has now created
	model notices to help plans and individuals comply with these requirements. Each model notice
	is designed for a particular group of qualified beneficiaries and contains information to help
	satisfy ARRA's notice provisions, including those added by the 2010 DOD Act.</p>

	<p><u><strong>Updated General Notice</strong></u></p>

	<p>Plans subject to the Federal COBRA provisions must provide the updated General Notice to all
	qualified beneficiaries (not just covered employees) who experienced a qualifying event at any
	time from September 1, 2008 through February 28, 2010, regardless of the type of qualifying
	event, and who have not yet been provided an election notice. This model notice includes
	updated information on the premium reduction and the extended eligibility period as well as
	information required in a COBRA election notice.</p>

	<p><strong>Note:</strong> Individuals who experienced a qualifying event (that was a termination of employment) in
	December 2009 but who were not eligible for COBRA coverage until January 2010 were likely
	not provided proper notice. These individuals should get the updated General Notice AND the
	full 60 days from the date the updated notice is provided to make a COBRA election.
	Premium Assistance Extension Notice</p>

	<p>Plan administrators must provide notice to certain individuals who have already been provided a
	COBRA election notice that did not include information regarding ARRA, as amended. This
	model <strong>Premium Assistance Extension Notice</strong> includes information about the changes made to
	the premium reduction provisions of ARRA by the 2010 DOD Act. Listed below are the affected
	individuals and the associated timing requirements.</p>


	<ul><li>Individuals who were "assistance eligible individuals" as of October 31, 2009 (unless
	they are in a transition period - see below), and individuals who experienced a
	termination of employment on or after October 31, 2009 and lost health coverage (unless
	they were already provided a timely, updated General Notice) must be provided notice
	of the changes made to the premium reduction provisions of ARRA by the 2010 DOD
	Act by February 17, 2010;</li>
	<li>Individuals who are in a "transition period" must be provided this notice within 60 days
	of the first day of the transition period. An individual's "transition period" is the period
	that begins immediately after the end of the maximum number of months (generally nine)
	of premium reduction available under ARRA prior to its amendment. An individual is in
	a transition period only if the premium reduction provisions would continue to apply due
	to the extension from nine to 15 months and they otherwise remain eligible for the
	premium reduction.</li></ul>

	<p><strong>Note:</strong> To some extent, the groups listed above overlap - creating a situation where an individual
	may be entitled to multiple notices. Providing the <strong>Premium Assistance Extension Notice</strong> by
	the earliest date required will satisfy the notice requirement(s).</p>

	<strong><u>Updated Alternative Notice</u></strong>

	<p>Insurance issuers that provide group health insurance coverage must send the updated
	Alternative Notice to persons who became eligible for continuation coverage under a State law.
	Continuation coverage requirements vary among States and issuers should modify this model
	notice as necessary to conform it to the applicable State law. Issuers may also find the model
	<strong>Premium Assistance Extension Notice</strong> or the updated model <strong>General Notice</strong> appropriate for
	use in certain situations.</p>

	<p>The Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration has also posted new
	information on the COBRA page (<a href="www.dol.gov/COBRA" target="_blank">www.dol.gov/COBRA</a>), adding an updated fact sheet, FAQS
	for employees, and posters and flyers updated for the provisions extending the ARRA premium
	reduction in the 2010 DOD Act, 2010.</p>

	<p><b>HEALTH CARE REFORM - WHAT HAPPENS NOW?</b></p>

	<p>The halls of Congress are still shaking after the special election upset victory of Massachusetts
	Republican Scott Brown over Democrat Martha Coakley in the race to fill the late Senator Ted
	Kennedy's seat. With their filibuster-proof majority in the Senate eliminated, congressional
	Democrats and the Obama administration are scrambling to figure out a way to move health
	reform forward.</p>

	<p>Initially there was talk about an attempt to rush an agreement through on a bill before Senatorelect
	Brown could be sworn in and seated in the Senate. However, that option has been
	effectively eliminated for a number of reasons. This leaves the Democrats with several different
	political options, each of which has problems. They include:</p>

	<ul>
	<li><em>Having the House approve the Senate bill, thereby avoiding another Senate
	vote.</em> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced that she does not have
	the 218 votes to do this.</li><p></p>
	<li><em>Getting the House to approve the Senate-passed bill, along with a separate
	pre-negotiated bill to "fix" all of the problems House members see in the
	current legislation.</em></li><p></p>
	<li><em>Attempting to pass legislation through the Senate using the budget
	reconciliation process, which only requires 51 votes.</em></li><p></p>
	<li><em>Trying to get a Senate Republican to serve as the 60th vote.</em></li><p></p>
	<li><em>Negotiating a limited health insurance reform bill and/or trying to include
	some of the more popular health insurance reforms in a jobs bill.</em></li><p></p>
	<li><em>Taking up several smaller health care bills that break the package into
	smaller, easier-to-digest and easier-to-sell chunks, which may be pursued
	along partisan or bipartisan lines.</em></li><p></p>
	<li><em>A final option would be scrapping the current bills and starting from scratch
	on health reform.</em></li></ul>
