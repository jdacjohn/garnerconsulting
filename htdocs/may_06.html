<strong>ERISA-Related Cases Show Trend Towards Allowing More Recoveries</strong>

<p align="justify">The 6<sup>th</sup> Circuit Court of Appeals recently decided that a man who was overpaid disability benefits does not have to repay the insurer. Though ERISA Section 502(a)(3) authorizes a civil action:</p>

<blockquote>By a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates . . . the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of . . . the terms of the plan.</blockquote>

<p align="justify">In this case, Charles Buchanan v. Aetna Life Insurance Co., the 6<sup>th</sup> Circuit ruled that Aetna’s suit to recover overpayments did not constitute equitable relief.</p>

<p align="justify">This is in keeping with a 2002 decision by the US Supreme Court that imposing personal liability for a contractual obligation did not constitute “equitable” relief. The decision in the 2002 case, <em>Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company v. Knudson</em>, seems to have been overturned recently in the case of <em>Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services Inc.</em> (MAMSI).</p>

<p align="justify">In this recent case, the court considered the question of whether an ERISA fiduciary can sue a beneficiary for reimbursement of medical expenses paid by the plan if the beneficiary later recovers damages from a third party. The decision upheld the rights of insurers to seek reimbursement from patients who have collected payments from a third party. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote: "The only question here is whether the relief requested was equitable".</p>

<p align="justify">MAMSI paid $74,869.37 to Joel and Marlene Sereboff for injuries sustained in an automobile accident. After the Sereboffs successfully sued a third party for $750,000 in damages, MAMSI sought reimbursement for the amount it had paid. The funds were clearly traceable, identifiable and in the Sereboffs' possession. Furthermore, MAMSI's contract included an "acts of third parties" provision, asserting rights to reimbursement when participants recover damages.</p>

<p align="justify">Roberts went on to say: "Mid Atlantic's action in the District Court properly sought equitable relief". The court reconfirmed the lower court orders for the Sereboffs to repay MAMSI.</p>

<p align="justify">In light of this new precedent, cases such as the Aetna case described above, may have a different outcome. Even so, passage of clarifying language by Congress would be helpful.</p>

<p align="justify">Currently, language in the House version of a pension reform bill (H.R. 2830) would give ERISA plans the right to seek the type of relief Aetna sought in the <em>Buchanan v. Aetna</em> case. The Senate version of pension reform does not have a comparable provision. A conference committee is now working out the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill.</p>
 
<p><strong>Hawaii Passes Bill to Cover More Children</strong></p>

<p align="justify">Agreed to on April 28<sup>th</sup>, the Keiki Care bill is intended to establish a pilot program for providing health coverage to children who are currently ineligible for state or federal health care coverage. The state and the local Blue Cross/ Blue Shield organization, the Hawaii Medical Service Association, will split costs of about $600,000 each.</p>

<p align="justify">Families with incomes of up to 300% of the federal poverty level would qualify for the program. At about $60,000 for a family of four, this is a higher level than is allowed for many such programs, but is still a level at which it can be unaffordable for the family to purchase health coverage.</p>

<p align="justify">With an estimated 10,000 children in Hawaii currently uninsured, the program is seen as an important step towards universal health care in the state. Hawaii already has a very different health care market than the rest of the United States, due to the Prepaid Health Care Act. This legislation, which mandates that employers of any workers working half time or more provide health coverage, has already made Hawaii one of the states with the fewest uninsured citizens in the US. Now, between the Prepaid Health Care Act, state and federal programs for families earning up to 200% of the federal poverty level, and Keiki Care, Hawaii will continue to lower the number of uninsured in the state.</p>

<p><strong>CMS Releases 2007 Part D Details</strong></p>

<p align="justify">In April CMS released the numbers for Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage in 2007. The standard benefit parameters are very similar, but with increases throughout. They are:</p>

<ul type="square">
<li>$265 rather than $250 for the deductible</li>
<li>$2,400 rather than $2,250 for the initial coverage limit</li>
<li>$3,850 rather than $3,600 for the True Out of Pocket Limit</li>
<li>Minimum copays for the catastrophic benefit are $2.15 rather than $2.00 for generics and $5.35. rather than $5.00 for brand name drugs</li>
<li>And the cost threshold for the retiree drug subsidy is $265 and the cost limit is $5,350.</li></ul> 
 
<p><strong>DOL Updates Voluntary Fiduciary Compliance Program</strong></p>

<p align="justify">In April the Department of Labor released details on the updates to the fiduciary voluntary correction program, which is meant to help plan sponsors correct any compliance issues they may have with their employee benefit plans.</p>
  
<p align="justify">In the words of the Department of Labor’s 2000 Notice announcing the program, “The VFC Program allows certain persons to avoid potential Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) civil actions initiated by the Department of Labor, and the assessment of civil penalties under section 502(l) of ERISA in connection with investigation or civil action by the Department.”</p>

<p align="justify">The program has been expanded and updated to make it more user-friendly, with simpler transactions, streamlined documentation, a model application form and relief from civil penalties for issues involving health and welfare plans.</p>
