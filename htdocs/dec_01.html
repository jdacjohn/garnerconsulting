<b>DOL Publishes Guidance On Claim Regulations</b>

<p align="justify">On December 17, 2001, the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration of the U. S. Department of Labor (DOL) published 48 frequently asked questions and answers providing guidance under the claim regulations published on November 21, 2000. The regulations apply to all plans subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), but have their greatest impact on health and disability plans.

<p>The Q & As clarify that:

<ul type="square">
<li>The DOL believes that any time a claim is paid in an amount less than 100% of the amount submitted, it should be treated as a partial denial and all appropriate notifications related to denials must be provided. For example, if a plan pays 80% of covered charges, a claimant submits a receipt for $100 of covered charges and the plan pays its full liability of $80, the plan must still notify the claimant of the right to appeal and set forth the specific reasons for the "denial".</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>For purposes of the regulations, the rules related to disability benefits apply to any benefit that is based on a determination of disability. Therefore, retirement disability, waiver of life insurance premiums for disability or extended health coverage for disabled claimants all may be considered disability benefits.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>While the regulations specify the period of time within which a claim must be decided, the regulations do not require payment within that time period. Plans may make payment within a "reasonable" period of time following the determination.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Plans that require a physical examination of the claimant must design a process that provides for decision making within the time frames of the regulations. If necessary, a plan may take an extension of time to enable the physician to submit a report of an examination. A plan must allow claimants at least 45 days to submit to an examination.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>When a claim is denied, the plan must indicate if an internal rule, guideline or protocol had been relied upon and that the specific rule will be furnished upon request at no charge; the plan is not required to specify the identity of the specific rule. A general statement that a rule, guideline or protocol may have been relied upon does not provide the claimant specific information and would not satisfy the requirements of the regulations.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Even proprietary rules, guidelines or protocols developed by a third party must be disclosed. Underlying data or information used to develop any rule, guideline or protocol do not need to be provided.</li></ul>

<p>Other clarifications include:

<ul type="square">
<li>A contractual dispute between a health care provider and a managed care organization does not constitute a claim under ERISA.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>If a plan does not require prior approvals, a request for a prior approval does not require the same expedited handling as a request for an authorization that is required.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>If a claimant fails to provide all the information necessary to decide a claim and the claimant is notified of the need for additional information, the time period for making a decision is suspended (tolled) from the date the claimant is notified.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Plans may request specific information from a claimant regarding the medical circumstances that give rise to the need for expedited processing required for urgent claims.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Plans can require that appeals be made in writing, except for appeals of urgent requests for authorizations.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Plans may require nonbinding arbitration of appeals, provided the arbitration takes place within the time frames required in the regulations.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Plans are only required to disclose the identity of expert consultants when requested to do so.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Providing only the name of a company that employs an expert consultant does not satisfy the requirements of the regulations-the name of the individual must be provided.</li></ul>

<p align="justify">The Q & As state: "The Department believes that prudent plan administration requires ensuring that similarly situated claims are, under similar circumstances, decided in a consistent manner. Consistency in the benefit claims determinations might be ensured by applying protocols, guidelines, criteria, rate tables, fee schedules, etc. Consistent decision making might be ensured and verified by periodic examinations, reviews, or audits of benefit claims to determine whether the appropriate protocols, guidelines, criteria, rate tables, fee schedules, etc. were applied in the claims determination process."
