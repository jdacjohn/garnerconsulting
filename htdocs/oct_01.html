<b>IRS Issues Regulations On FMLA And Cafeteria Plans</b>

<p>On October 17, 2001, the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations in the <i>Federal Register</i> on the effect of the Family and Medical Leave Act on the operation of cafeteria plans. Generally, under FMLA, an employer has the obligation to offer coverage under any group health plan for the duration of FMLA leave under the same conditions as for active employees.

<p>These regulations clarify proposed regulations issued in 1995. The final regulations confirm much of what was in the proposed regulations, but also make some changes.

<p>The proposed regulations specifically prohibited an employer from requiring an employee whose coverage terminated while on FMLA leave to reinstate coverage under a health care flexible spending account upon return from FMLA leave. The final regulations state that upon return from FMLA leave, an employee who revoked coverage or failed to pay premiums has the right to be reinstated. The employer can require the employee to resume participation if the employer also requires employees who return from unpaid non-FMLA leave to resume participation upon return from leave.

<p>Also with regard to health FSAs, the proposed regulations permitted coverage to be reduced after the employee resumes work if the employee did not have coverage during the FMLA leave. Under the final regulations, the employer must provide the employee a choice between:

<ul type="square">
<li>resuming coverage at the original level and making up the unpaid premiums, or</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>resuming premiums at the original level and having a prorated level of coverage.</li></ul>

<p>Under the proposed regulations, an employee who elected to use the catch-up payment option was required to elect that option before the leave. The final regulations provide greater flexibility by eliminating the requirement for an advance election.

<p>The final regulations clarify that employees on FMLA leave must be allowed to participate in open enrollments. The final regulations also clarify that employees on FMLA leave must be able to make the same election changes as an employee not on leave if there is a status change, a change in cost or coverage or any other change that would allow a mid-year change in elections under the cafeteria plan.

<p><b>MEDICARE Changes Announced</b>

<p>On October 19, 2001, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced the annual Medicare changes for 2002, including:

<ul type="square">
<li>The inpatient hospital deductible will be $812, up from $792 in 2001.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>The daily coinsurance amount for the 61<sup>st</sup> through 90<sup>th</sup> days of hospitalization in a benefit period will be $203, up from $198.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>The daily coinsurance amount for lifetime reserve days will be $406, up from $396.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>The Part B monthly premium will be $54, up from $50.</li></ul>

<p><b>House Passes Block Grants For Health Insurance</b>

<p>On October 24, 2001, the U. S. House of Representatives passed an economic stimulus package that includes $3 billion for states to help people who have lost their health insurance following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The bill would allow states to use the money in any way they want to expand health insurance coverage. A Democratic bill to pay 75% of COBRA premiums was defeated. The Senate has not yet begun work on its version of the bill, although a number of proposals to pay COBRA premiums or provide tax credits for health insurance have been introduced.
