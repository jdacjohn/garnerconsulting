<b>Wal-Mart, States, Labor Continue To Consider Health Care Mandates</b>

<p align="justify">As retail giant Wal-Mart released preliminary information about changes to its benefit plan offerings, the AFL-CIO has released a study called "The Wal-Mart Tax: Shifting Health Care Costs to Taxpayers." Meanwhile, New Jersey, Maryland, California, Kentucky and Connecticut have all been considering legislation that aims to increase employer-sponsored insurance coverage.</p>  

<p align="justify">Without providing much specific information, Wal-Mart attempted to counter the bad rap it has been getting by announcing improvements to their health plans. The eligibility period, currently a whopping 24 months, will be shortened, though the company is not sure what the new period will be. They also point out that they offered new, lower-premium plans last fall, and have 70,000 new enrollees since then. The press release also announced that Wal-Mart will contract for the construction of 50 new on-site health clinics this year.</p>  

<p align="justify">This announcement comes at a time in which at least 30 states are contemplating "play or pay" legislation along the lines of the Maryland Fair Share Act. In addition, Maryland has new legislation up for debate which would mandate spending levels for employers with fewer than 10,000 employees as well. In the new legislation, non-profit organizations would be required to spend at least 3% of payroll costs on health care, and for-profit organizations 4.5%. Individuals whose income is above 350% of the poverty level and who waive employer-sponsored coverage would be required to pay income tax on an amount equal to certain public benefits received.</p> 

<p align="justify">Meanwhile, New Jersey's Senate has passed legislation that would publish the names, locations and other statistics for employers in that state who have 50 or more employees enrolled in the state's FamilyCare low-income insurance program. This bill is in keeping with suggestions published in the AFL-CIO's recent report on their model Health Care Disclosure Act.</p> 

<p align="justify">The AFL-CIO reports that five states (Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts and Washington) have introduced such bills and that three (Hawaii, Illinois and Massachusetts) have enacted them into law. In addition, the report details the role Wal-Mart plays in Medicaid costs in several states, which made the decision to publish the names of companies whose employees receive publicly-funded health care.</p> 

<p><b>CMS Reports Accelerating Health Care Cost Trends</b></p>

<p align="justify">The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a report at the end of February forecasting that one out of every five dollars spent in the US will be spent on health care by the year 2015. The predicted sharp rise from the current 16.2% of GDP to 20% is attributed to increased hospital care spending, home health, drugs and public health programs. The Medicare Part D prescription drug plan is a culprit, boosting government drug spending from 2% of national prescription drug spending in 2005 to 27% in 2006. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita are also cited for spiking public health spending by nearly 25%. CMS reports that cost-cutting measures will be unlikely to have a great effect on this trend, but some experts do believe that options such as consumer-driven health care and disease management will help to slow cost increases.</p> 

<p><b>CDHC Attracts Few Fed Employees, Requires Stellar Communication</b></p>

<p align="justify">The federal government reported in February that the first year enrollment in high deductible health plans (HDHP) consisted of higher-income employees across all age brackets. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) commented that the combination of larger financial risk and tax advantages make the plans particularly attractive to people with higher incomes.</p> 

<p align="justify">The GAO also reported that the provision of health information and education was lacking in this first year, most notably information helpful in choosing well-priced and effective providers. This is in line with a March report released by New York's OnlineBenefits, which surveyed business leaders about the communications necessary to a successful HDHP rollout. The most important tools to provide employees were account tracking, drug information and wellness programs, with disease management, consumer education, health risk assessments and nurse hotlines also noted. Two thirds of respondents believe that employees need a great deal of support in implementing HDHP, and only 26% believe their employees are capable of managing their benefits independently.</p>  

<p><b>EBRI Releases Study Recommending Evidence-Based Medicine</b></p> 

<p align="justify">The Employee Benefits Research Institute (EBRI) in February released a study regarding integration of concepts of evidence-based medicine in health plan design. Evidence-based medicine can be more explicitly included, EBRI states, in order to focus plan dollars on services which are proven to improve patient health.</p>  

<p align="justify">Though it could lead to greater use of valuable health care services and lower utilization of marginal services, the concept has met with resistance in the field. Obstacles to implementation include thoughts that there is a lack of evidence, that credibility is low, that financial relationships are opaque and administrative costs high. However, the state of Oregon has developed a plan design that is organized around medical evidence and all health plans currently administering Medicaid for the state have been profitable as changes were implemented.</p>  

<p><b>HHS Clarifies Release Criteria For PHI</b></p>

<p align="justify">The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has released a clarification regarding the release of protected health information (PHI) to individuals related to or acting on behalf of a beneficiary. Plans may release information to a relative or close friend inasmuch as that person is involved in payment for the beneficiary's care. Also HR representatives who can hand off the phone to an employee beneficiary or have them on the line while speaking to the plan may receive PHI. Last, CMS staff may receive PHI if they are acting to assist Part D beneficiaries and can reasonably convince the plan of this fact.</p> 

<p><b>FMLA Notice Could Be Impractical, Federal Judge Rules</b></p>

<p align="justify">An Alabama US District Court judge has upheld an employee's claim that he gave his employer proper notice of the need for FMLA leave when he called 54 minutes before his shift was to start. Noting that the law's language allows for notification "as soon as practicable" the court stated that the employee may truly not have been aware of the need an hour before shift start, making the employer's requirement of one hour's notice impracticable. In this case, the employee's wife began suffering complications of pregnancy shortly before his shift started, and he sued his employer because he was fired for his failure to come to work that day.<p>
