<b>Supreme Court Rules On HMO Review Boards And ERISA</b>

<p align="justify">In <i>Rush Prudential HMO vs. Moran</i>, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on June 20, 2002 that because HMOs are both insurance and employee benefit plans, state regulations are not superseded by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974.

<p align="justify">Most states (42) and the District of Columbia have independent review boards to which patients can appeal when their HMO denies coverage. While there have been only 3,957 such cases since the first review law was passed in Michigan in 1978, advocates contend they are a crucial means for patients to receive a second opinion outside of their HMO.

<p align="justify">At issue before the Supreme Court was whether or not these state laws providing for independent review boards were pre-empted by ERISA. The Court ruled that such state laws are not in conflict with ERISA. HMOs contend that they are not opposed to review boards, but rather to the variance in such laws, due to them being state and not federal laws.

<p align="justify">The case highlights the conflict between the need for patients rights as well as the need to keep costs contained.

<p><b>Supreme Court Rules On Americans With Disabilities Act</b>

<p align="justify">The Supreme Court also ruled 9-0 on June 10, 2002 that the Americans with Disabilities Act does not allow people the right to jobs that could put their health at risk.

<p align="justify">It had previously been determined that employers could refuse to hire individuals if their employment would pose a direct threat to the health of others; this ruling extends the right of employers to refuse to hire individuals if employment would put their own health at risk.

<p align="justify">In this ruling, the Court upheld an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulation recognizing "threat to self" as a defense to an employer's refusal to hire.

<p align="justify">The case, <i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Mario Echazabal</i>, involved a contracted employee working at a Chevron refinery who applied for a position directly through Chevron at the same refinery. He was offered a position, contingent upon a pre-employment physical, which revealed that he had Hepatitis C, a liver disorder which could be exacerbated through contact with the chemicals and solvents at the refinery. Chevron's refusal to hire Echazabal was based on the "threat to self" defense, which the Court accepted.

<p><b>Health And Human Services Announces Employer Identification Numbers As Standard Identifier</b>

<p align="justify">The Department of Health and Human Services announced in the May 31, 2002 <i>Federal Register</i> that the unique employer identification numbers assigned by the Internal Revenue Service must be used when filing and processing health care claims.

<p align="justify">This change is mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and is "effective" July 30, 2002. The compliance date for most plans will be 24 months after the effective date, and for small health plans compliance will be required no later than 36 months after the effective date.

<p align="justify">In the past, various health care organizations could use different identification numbers to distinguish the same employer; using the same standard unique identifier already provided to employers who pay wages is intended to simplify such processes as enrolling new employees. The employer identification numbers will be required to be used in any transaction in which the employer needs to be recognized.
