	<p><b>HOUSE PASSES HEALTH CARE REFORM</b></p>

	<p>Late in the night on November 7, 2009, the House of Representatives passed its version of health care
	reform. If the Senate can pass health care reform legislation, it will be up to a conference committee to
	work out differences between the two versions.</p>



	<p><b>MILITARY FAMILY LEAVE EXPANDED</b></p>

	<p>On October 28, 2009, President Obama signed H.R. 2647 (the Fiscal Year 2010 National Defense
	Authorization Act) into law. This new law includes two expansions of the recently-enacted exigency and
	caregiver leave provisions for military families under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
	(FMLA).</p>

	<ul>
	<li>	The National Defense Authorization Act expands the exigency leave benefits to include family
	members of active duty service members. Under prior law, only family members of National
	Guard and Reservists were eligible for exigency leave.</li>
	<li>The National Defense Authorization Act also expands the caregiver leave provision to include
	veterans who are undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy for serious injury or
	illness that occurred any time during the five years preceding the date of treatment.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>These provisions are effective immediately.</p>

	<p>On October 30, 2009 the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published an interim final
	rule to conform HIPAA's enforcement regulations to the new statutory revisions required by the Health
	Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the HITECH Act), which was enacted as
	part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This new rule revises HIPAA's
	enforcement regulations with respect to the imposition of civil monetary penalties by incorporating
	HITECH's categories of violations and tiered ranges of civil monetary penalty amounts, and by revising
	HIPAA's limitations on the Secretary of HHS's authority to impose civil monetary penalties for
	violations of the HIPAA rules. This interim final rule will be effective November 30, 2009.</p>

	<p>Prior to the HITECH Act, HIPAA allowed the Secretary of HHS to impose civil monetary penalties on
	persons violating the HIPAA rules of not more than $100 per violation up to a maximum of $25,000 for
	all violations occurring during a calendar year. HIPAA also limited the Secretary's authority to impose
	such penalties under various circumstances.</p>
	<p>The HITECH Act strengthens the Secretary's enforcement authority by establishing four categories of
	violations that reflect increasing levels of culpability on the part of the covered entity, by defining tiers of
	increasing civil monetary penalties that the Secretary can impose, and by requiring that the Secretary base
	penalties on the nature and extent of the violation as well as the nature and the extent of the harm
	resulting from the violation. HITECH's tiered penalty structure represents a significant increase in the
	liability of covered entities for civil monetary penalties. Prior to the HITECH Act, HIPAA allowed the
	Secretary of HHS to impose civil monetary penalties on persons violating the HIPAA rules of not more
	than $100 per violation up to a maximum of $25,000 for all violations occurring during a calendar year.
	Under this new rule, applicable to violations occurring on or after February 18, 2009, the Secretary can
	impose civil monetary penalties for each violation ranging from at least $100 to a maximum of $50,000
	for the lowest category violation. Under the highest category violation, the Secretary can impose a
	$50,000 penalty per violation. Additionally the HITECH Act increases the maximum penalty that the
	Secretary can impose for all such violations of the same HIPAA provision in a calendar year from
	$25,000 to $1,500,000.</p>

	<p>The new rule also eliminates certain affirmative defenses which were previously available to covered
	entities. For example, under the prior rule, a covered entity had an affirmative defense if the entity did
	not know and reasonably should not have known that a violation occurred. Under the HITECH
	provisions of this new rule, this will only be an affirmative defense if the covered entity also corrects the
	violation during the 30-day period beginning on the first date of such knowledge or during the period
	determined by the Secretary to be appropriate based on the nature and extent of the covered entity's
	failure to comply. The new rule also does not alter affirmative defenses with respect to violations due to
	willful neglect. HIPAA still operates to exclude violations due to willful neglect from those other
	violations that, if timely corrected, would be exempted from the imposition of a civil monetary penalty.
	Accordingly under this new rule, timely correction of a violation due to willful neglect will not constitute
	an affirmative defense. However, timely correction will determine which tier of penalty amounts is
	applicable.</p>

	<p><b>GOVERNMENT MISSES DEADLINE FOR MENTAL HEALTH PARITY
	REGULATIONS</b></p>
	<p>
	When President Bush signed the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction
	Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA) on October 3, 2008, that triggered a requirement for the Internal Revenue
	Service, Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue
	regulations no later than October 3, 2009. Earlier this month, HHS announced that the regulations will be
	delayed. They said the new goal is to issue regulations by January 2010. In the absence of regulations,
	plan sponsors will have to make reasonable good faith efforts to comply with MHPAEA.</p>
	<p>MHPAEA prohibits group health plans from imposing financial requirements such as deductibles,
	copayments, coinsurance and out-of-pocket limits with respect to mental health or substance abuse
	benefits which are more restrictive than the financial requirements that apply to substantially all of the
	medical and surgical benefits under the plan. The new law is effective with respect to plan years
	beginning after October 3, 2009, unless a collective bargaining agreement in place on October 3, 2008 has
	yet to expire.</p>
