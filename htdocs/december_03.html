<b>Health Savings Accounts Offer Benefit Planners New Options</b>

<p align="justify">On December 8, 2003, President Bush signed the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act, the most sweeping changes in the history of Medicare. Last month’s bulletin summarized the legislation and this month’s bulletin provides additional details about health savings accounts (HSAs).

<p align="justify">HSAs provide tax-favored treatment for current medical expenses as well as the ability to save on a tax-favored basis for future medical expenses. In general, HSAs are tax-exempt trusts or custodial accounts created exclusively to pay for the qualified medical expenses of the account holder and his or her spouse and dependents. HSAs are subject to rules similar to those applicable to individual retirement accounts.

<p align="justify">Within limits, contributions to HSAs are deductible if made by an eligible individual and are excludable from gross income for employment tax purposes if made by the employer. Distributions from HSAs for qualified medical expenses are not includible in gross income. Distributions that are not for qualified medical expenses are includible in gross income and subject to a 10% tax. The tax does not apply after death, disability or Medicare eligibility.

<p align="justify">In order to be eligible for an HSA, an individual must be covered by a high deductible health plan and have no other health plan. Certain other coverage is permitted, such as disability, dental, vision, long-term care, accident-only policies, workers’ compensation, auto insurance, coverage that is only for specified diseases and coverage that provides a fixed payment for hospitalization.

<p align="justify">Individuals entitled to Medicare are not eligible to make contributions to an HSA. Individuals who may be claimed as a dependent on another person’s tax return are not eligible for an HSA.

<p align="justify">A high deductible health plan must have a deductible of at least $1,000 (indexed) for self-only coverage or $2,000 for family coverage. The family coverage limit will always be twice the individual limit, as indexed for inflation. The plan must have an out-of-pocket limit that is no more than $5,000 for individual coverage and $10,000 for family coverage. Limits can be higher for out-of-network coverage. The definition of out-of-pocket expenses includes deductibles, co-payments and other amounts (other than premiums) that the individual must pay for covered benefits. Plans can exclude preventive care from the deductible.

<p align="justify">Surprisingly, the law allows contributions to an HSA to be made on a salary reduction basis through a cafeteria plan. This is an exception to the general rule that cafeteria plans cannot include deferred compensation. Contributions can be made by either the employee and the employer or both, subject to the maximum annual contribution limit.

<p align="justify">The maximum annual contribution that can be made to an HSA is the lesser of the annual deductible under the high deductible health plan or the maximum deductible permitted under an Archer MSA high deductible health plan under present law, as adjusted for inflation.

<p align="justify">Annual contribution limits are higher for individuals who have attained age 55 by the end of the taxable year. The limit is $500 higher in 2004, phasing up to $1,000 more in 2009 and thereafter. Contributions, including catch-up contributions, cannot be made to an HSA once the individual is eligible for Medicare.

<p align="justify">Contributions to an Archer MSA reduce the annual contribution limits for HSAs. Amounts can be rolled over into an HSA from another HSA or from an Archer MSA.

<p align="justify">If an employer makes contributions to employees’ HSAs, the employer must make available comparable contributions on behalf of all employees with comparable coverage during the same period. Contributions are considered comparable if they are either of the same amount or the same percentage of the deductible under the plan. The comparability rule is applied separately to employees working fewer than 30 hours per week. The comparability rule does not apply to amounts transferred from another HSA, a health flexible spending account, an Archer MSA or to contributions made through a cafeteria plan.

<p align="justify">If employer contributions do not satisfy the comparability rule, then the employer is subject to an excise tax equal to 35% of the amount contributed by the employer. This tax is designed as a proxy for the denial of the deduction for employer contributions. The government has the power to waive all or part of the tax if the failure is due to reasonable cause not to willful neglect. Employers under common control are aggregated for purposes of the comparability rule.

<p align="justify">Qualified medical expenses generally are defined under Internal Revenue Code Section 213(d). Qualified medical expenses also include premiums for Medicare Part A and Part B, Medicare HMO premiums and the employee share of premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance for employees or retirees. Insurance premiums for COBRA coverage or long-term care insurance can also be paid from HSAs.

<p align="justify">Employer contributions must be reported on Form W-2. Trustees of HSAs may be required to report additional information, as may health insurers.

<p align="justify">HSAs can be effective as of January 1, 2004.
