	<p><b>GOOD NEWS FOR SPONSORS OF HEALTH FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTS</b></p>

	<p>The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 includes a broad definition of "creditor" and
	requires creditors to implement written identity theft programs. Because flexible spending accounts
	(FSAs) for health care are required to allow employees to submit claims for medical expenses in advance
	of payroll deductions, there was concern that health FSA plan sponsors would have to comply with the
	identity theft rule. The Federal Trade Commission, in an answer to a "frequently asked question" has said
	that sponsoring a health FSA does not make an employer a creditor under the terms of this law.</p>

	<p><b>CDC ISSUES GUIDANCE FOR EMPLOYERS TO PLAN FOR FLU SEASON</b></p>
	<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
	(CDC), with input from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has developed updated
	guidance for employers of all sizes to use as they develop or review and update plans to respond to 2009
	H1N1 influenza now and during the upcoming fall and winter influenza season. Employers should
	review and revise their plans in light of the current 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak to take into account the
	extent and severity of disease in their community as outlined in this guidance. Please check <a href="http://www.flu.gov" target="_blank">www.flu.gov</a>
	periodically for updated guidance.</p>

	<p><b>HEALTH CARE REFORM MYTHS AND FACTS</b></p>
	<p>The saga of health care reform is beginning to seem like a soap opera. Twists and turns occur on a daily
	basis. We thought about adding fuel to the fire by speculating about what might happen (as we have done
	in the past), but thought it might be more helpful to provide some background and facts. We realize that
	in doing so, we run the risk of offending everyone. That is not our intent. We simply want to dispel
	some false rumors by providing information.</p>
	<p>First, it is important to understand that there is no one health care reform proposal. There was one bill in
	the House, which went to three committees, each of which changed it, so now there are three versions
	with some conflicting provisions. In the Senate, there is an entirely separate bill passed by one committee
	(Health, Education, Labor & Pensions-HELP) and a very different bill being prepared by the Senate
	Finance Committee. That means there are four different versions passed by different committees with a
	fifth version in process.</p>
	<p>A disclaimer is also in order: each of the bills that has been passed out of a committee is about 1,000
	pages long. We have only read certain provisions, not all of them. We have used www.factcheck.org as
	a source of some information.</p>


	<p>One of the most controversial provisions involves the so-called "death panels", which have been called "a
	government run plan to decide when to pull the plug on grandma".</p>
	<p>Section 1861(s)2 of the Social Security Act, defines the services covered by Medicare. Section 1233 of
	the original H.R. 3200 (now modified by three committees), which is titled "Advance Care Planning
	Consultation" would amend this section to add some end-of-life planning counseling sessions with a
	health care practitioner to the list of services Medicare would cover. Counseling would be voluntary.
	You have probably heard it said "if you like your health care plan, you keep your health care plan". If
	passed, health care reform will almost certainly require employers to make changes to their plan design.
	Furthermore, there is nothing in current law or anything we have seen in the proposals that would prohibit
	employers from changing plan design or insurers.</p>
	<p>A group is running a TV ad saying Congress plans to pay for overhauling health care "by cutting $500
	billion from Medicare." It claims that this "will mean long waits for care" and cuts to services, that
	"seniors may lose their own doctors" and that "government, not doctors, will decide if older patients are
	worth the cost." According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the original version of the House
	bill would cut a net of $219 billion from the projected growth of Medicare spending over the next 10
	years. We have seen nothing in any Congressional proposal that would cut benefit levels or deny
	treatment, although there are proposals to reduce payments to insurers under Medicare Advantage plans.
	Some people have said that health care reform will be deficit-neutral. According to the CBO and Joint
	Committee on Taxation, the original version of the House bill would add a net $239 billion over 10 years
	to the deficit, while the HELP Committee bill would cost $597 billion over 10 years.</p>
	<p>In July, Investor's Business Daily published an editorial in which it claimed that H.R. 3200 would make
	private insurance illegal. Under the House bill, people who want to buy new individual coverage will
	have to purchase it through a new health insurance exchange. They can still buy private insurance - the
	exchange would offer a number of private plans, possibly in addition to a new federal health insurance
	option. People who were already buying individual insurance policies before the bill went into effect will
	have their plans grandfathered. The part of the bill the magazine cites doesn't forbid insurers from
	issuing new plans. It says that new individual plans will not be considered grandfathered, and will have
	to be purchased through the exchange.</p>
	<p>People have said health care reform could save $2,500 per family. However, the CBO says: "[E]xperts
	generally agree that changes in government policy have the potential to significantly reduce health care
	spending - for the nation as a whole and for the federal government in particular - without harming
	people's health. However, achieving large reductions in projected spending would require fundamental
	changes in the financing and delivery of health care."</p>
	<p>A press release claims that "5,600,000 Illegal Aliens May Be Covered Under Obamacare". Section 246
	of H.R. 3200 says: "Nothing in this subtitle shall allow Federal payments for affordability credits on
	behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States." That's legalese for "no federal
	payment for undocumented aliens."</p>
	<p>Garner Consulting comment: We need a vigorous debate on health care reform's details, but we also
	need to keep our facts straight. We hope this helps.</p>
