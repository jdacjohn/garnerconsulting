	<strong>REGULATIONS IMPLEMENT "PATIENT'S BILL OF RIGHTS" UNDER REFORM</strong>

	<p>On June 28, 2010, the Department of Labor (Employee Benefits Security Administration) (EBSA)
	along with the Departments of the Treasury (Internal Revenue Service) and Health and Human
	Services published regulations implementing the new "Patient's Bill of Rights" under the Patient
	Protection and Affordable Care Act. For plan years starting on or after September 23, 2010, health
	plans will not be able to:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>	Deny coverage to children based on a pre-existing condition, whether in the form of a benefit
		limitation or a denial of coverage for the child. So-called "grandfathered" plans will not be
		subject to this rule until 2014;</li>
	<li>	Rescind coverage for individuals or groups, except in cases involving fraud or intentional
		misrepresentation of material facts. Insurers and plans seeking to rescind coverage must
		provide at least 30 days advance notice to provide time to appeal the rescission;</li>
	<li>Impose lifetime limits on coverage;</li>
	<li>Impose annual dollar limits on coverage. Existing limits will be phased out over the next
	three years. Plans issued or renewed beginning September 23, 2010 may set annual limits no
	lower than $750,000, with the permissible limit increasing to $1.25 million beginning
	September 23, 2011 and to $2 million beginning September 23, 2012. Beginning with plans
	issued or renewed beginning January 1, 2014, all annual dollar limits on coverage of essential
	health benefits will be prohibited.</li>
	<li>Prohibit a health plan member from designating any available participating primary care
	provider as their provider. Parents may choose any available participating pediatrician to be
	their child's primary care provider..</li>
	<li>Require a referral for obstetrical or gynecological care.</li>
	<li>Impose higher cost-sharing requirements (copayments or coinsurance) for emergency
	services obtained outside of a plan's network of participating providers.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>These regulations may be found at <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-15278.pdf" target="_blank">http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-15278.pdf</a> and the

	<p><strong>HHS ISSUES PROPOSED REGULATIONS UNDER HITECH ACT</strong></p>

	<p>On Wednesday, July 14, 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services released regulations to
	implement statutory provisions of the HITECH Act which impact HIPAA's privacy, security and
	enforcement provisions.</p>

	<p>The proposed rules change some of the key definitions. Under the proposed rules, "business
	associate" will include persons performing patient safety activities (required by the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Acts of 2005 (PSQIA) as well as Health Information Organizations (HIOs), EPrescribing
	Gateways, vendors of personal health records, and persons that facilitate data
	transmissions. The definition of protected health information (PHI) will explicitly not include the
	individually identifiable health information of persons who have been deceased for more than 50
	years. And the definition of "workforce" will include employees, volunteers, trainees and other
	persons who work under the direct control of a business associate.</p>

	<p>The proposed rules also extend some Security Rule and Privacy Rule requirements to business
	associates and their subcontractors. Business associates will now have to implement the Security
	Rule's administrative, physical and technical safeguards, including documentation of appropriate
	policies and procedures, in the same manner as covered entities. Violations of these requirements
	may result in the business associate incurring civil and criminal penalties. The proposed rules would
	also allow business associates to use and disclose PHI only as permitted or required by HIPAA, their
	business associate contracts or other arrangements, or as provided by law. In addition, a business
	associate's subcontractors and other "downstream entities" will have to comply with applicable
	provisions of the privacy and security rules in the same way as is required of the primary business
	associate, and will likewise be liable for noncompliance.</p>

	<p>The proposed rules also will expand a covered entity's liability for civil penalties for violations by a
	business associate, even when the covered entity has a compliant business associate agreement in
	place, is unaware of any practice pattern or violation by the business associate, and responds
	appropriately once the covered entity becomes aware of the violation.</p>

	<p>The proposed rules will enhance an individual's privacy rights by establishing new limits on the use
	and disclosure of PHI for marketing and fundraising purposes, prohibiting the sale of PHI and
	expanding an individual's rights to access their PHI and to obtain restrictions on certain disclosures of
	PHI.</p>

	<p>Because HHS considers these proposed rules to be material changes, covered entities will have to
	revise and distribute updated Notices of Privacy Practices promptly. In view of the administrative
	burden these new regulations impose, HHS intends to allow covered entities and business associates
	up to 180 days following the effective date of the final rule in which to come into compliance.
	Further, HHS is proposing a transition period of up to one year after the compliance date for the final
	rule for covered entities and business associates to revise their business associate agreements.</p>



	<p><strong>U.S. SUPREME COURT REFUSES TO REVIEW SAN FRANCISCO DECISION</strong></p>

	<p>On June 28, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it would not review the 9th Circuit ruling
	that upheld the legality of San Francisco's law requiring employers to spend a minimum amount on
	health benefits for employees.</p>

	<p><strong>DOL CREATES SAFE HARBOR FOR MENTAL HEALTH PARITY</strong></p>

	<p>The Department of Labor has established a temporary safe harbor that will allow plans that have
	copayments for office visits and coinsurance for other outpatient services to comply more easily with
	the regulations under the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act.</p>
