<strong>FSA And HRA Rollovers To Health Savings Accounts Allowed In Some Cases</strong>

<p align="justify">The Internal Revenue Service issued a Notice on March 6, providing guidance on rollovers from health FSAs and HRAs to HSAs. The Notice served as clarification of an amendment to Internal Revenue Code section 223.</p>

<p align="justify">A rollover from a health FSA or HRA must not exceed the balance in the account as of September 21, 2006, or as of the date of the distribution. Also, all of the following conditions must be met:</p>

<ul>
<li>The plan must be amended by plan year end</li>
<li>The employee must elect the rollover</li>
<li>The year-end balance must be frozen</li>
<li>The funds must be transferred by the employer within two and a half months from the end of the plan year</li>
<li>The transfer must result in a zero balance in the health FSA or HRA.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">Employees are entitled to only one rollover for each health FSA or HRA they had on September 21, 2006.</p>  

<p align="justify">Timing makes a difference in whether the rollover can be made on a tax-free basis. If the rollover is not executed at the end of the plan year, or the employee is not covered by an HSA-compatible high deductible health plan (HDHP) at the time of the distribution, if the employee does not remain under HSA-compatible HDHP coverage for the 12 months following the distribution, the distribution must be included in income and is subject to an additional 10% tax. Employers who have HDHPs in place may wish, however, to offer the rollover as a way to encourage employees to switch from traditional plans to an HDHP.</p>


<p><strong>Surprise! Health Coverage Requires Contributions To the Plan</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On March 28<sup>th</sup>, the US District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee ruled to uphold a summary plan description (SPD) that requires employees to pay their contributions to health plan premiums in order to maintain coverage. The case involved an employee of Lowe’s Home Centers, Inc. who erroneously received health plan ID cards for himself and his wife, though he declined coverage when he began employment. During the following open enrollment, the employee did enroll in the plan and deductions were made from his paychecks. </p> 

<p align="justify">The employee took two leaves of absence, one during the time in which he was not enrolled in the health plan, and one during the time in which he was enrolled. Both times, he received notifications that his coverage would end if he failed to pay his premiums. Lowe’s charged that the employee was not entitled to coverage during any of the periods during which he did not pay his premiums, and the court upheld their claim that the incorrectly-issued ID cards were not a recognition of coverage, and therefore the company has the right to recover claims paid in error during those times. </p>

<p><strong>Court Rules SPD Is Plan Document, If That's All There Is</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On March 16, the 8<sup>th</sup> US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that an SPD can be a legally controlling plan document, if there is no other formal written plan document. The case involved a Wal-Mart employee whose husband had received a settlement in the case of a car accident that had rendered him permanently disabled. The company wished to recoup the $175,000 in claims that had been paid on his behalf, and the employee pushed back, claiming that the reimbursement clause in the SPD was not enforceable because it was not in a formal plan document. The ruling made clear that the SPD can serve as the formal plan document, when there is no other documentation in place. In addition, the court noted, the SPD even contained a mention that portions of it served as part of Wal-Mart’s official plan document.</p>

<p><strong>HSA Enrollments Highest With Large Employers</strong></p>

<p align="justify">A recent survey conducted by America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, shows that HSA participation has increased by 43% since last year. The greatest increase was in the large-group market, which grew at three times the rate of small groups. In January 2007, two million employees of large employers were enrolled in HSAs, up from 679,000 in 2006 and 162,000 in 2005. Smaller group enrollment in HSAs went up from 510,000 in 2006 to 1.1 million. </p> 

<p align="justify">Much of this growth is caused by the fact that many employees no longer have a choice between HDHP and other kinds of plans. However, more than 90% of employers surveyed offer HDHP plans with preventive benefits not subject to the deductible.</p>

<p><strong>Jury Finds Discrimination In “Comfort Animal” Case</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On March 12, jurors awarded $45,000 to a woman who claimed she was fired for bringing her dog to work. Claiming that the dog eased her anxiety and depression, the woman sued when a new boss told her she had to stop bringing the dog to work, after 8 years of doing so. The jury did not find that the woman had a mental disability, therefore leaving unaddressed the question as to whether an employee should be allowed to bring a “comfort animal” to work. It did affirm, however, that the woman’s employer had retaliated against her for filing a disability grievance.</p> 
 
<p align="justify">The hope had been voiced that this case might extend to the workplace a state appeals court ruling that comfort animals should be allowed in housing complexes that usually don’t allow dogs. This, however, was not the case.</p>

<p><strong>Health Care Costs Among Greatest Concerns</strong></p>

<p align="justify">In a survey published by the American Society for Quality, 79% of those polled reported health care costs as a greater concern to them than the war in Iraq. In addition, one in four respondents said that they have not filled a prescription or have delayed a procedure due to cost, and women are more likely than men to do so. Sixty eight percent (68%) of those surveyed said that they thought people becoming less dependent on health insurance companies for their healthcare would improve the overall quality of healthcare. Men are more likely than women to believe this.</p>
