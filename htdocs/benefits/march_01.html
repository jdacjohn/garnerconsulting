<b>Supreme Court Refuses To Hear Retiree Case</b> 

<p>On March 5, 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it declined to review a lower court ruling that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act requires employers to provide the same level of benefits to older retirees that it provides to retirees under age 65.

<p>The decision is only binding in the Third Circuit (Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania), but is should be of concern not only to employers based in those states, but also to employers with operations in those states. Until Congress acts or another Circuit issues a conflicting opinion and the Supreme Court rules upon it, employers will be faced with uncertainty as to whether a popular plan design is permitted.

<p><b>Regulatory Moratorium</b>

<p>In accordance with the regulatory moratorium announced by the Bush Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services announced on March 9, 2001 that the effective date of the interim final and temporary nondiscrimination regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act has been postponed until May 8, 2001. The delay is apparently intended to allow the new administration time to review the new regulations.

<p>Among the many issues addressed by the regulations are actively-at-work provisions, non-confinement clauses, benefit-specific exclusions and differences in benefits between otherwise similarly situated employees. Typical actively-at-work provisions are prohibited under the interim final regulations. Plans can terminate coverage for failure to satisfy a minimum hours or service requirement, as long as employees absent for health reasons are treated no less favorably than employees absent for other reasons.

<p><b>Privacy Rules Postponed By Clerical Error</b>

<p>On February 23, 2001, the Bush Administration announced that the final privacy regulations issued in December 2000 would be delayed. Under the Congressional Review Act, the Department of Health and Human Services was required to submit this regulation for consideration by Congress for a 60-day period. Due to an oversight under the prior administration, this requirement was not met. As a result, the 60-day period of Congressional review did not begin until February 13, 2001. Therefore, the effective date of the regulation has been delayed until April 14, 2001 and the date by which compliance is required for most health plans has been postponed until April 14, 2003.

<p>The Department of Health and Human Services also opened the regulations to a brief period of public comment. HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson has said the department will review the comments to determine whether changes in the final rule are needed.

<p><b>Medicare's Life Expectancy Extended Again</b>

<p>Each year, the Trustees of the Medicare trust fund, report in detail on its financial condition. Thanks to the strong economy last year, the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund will not be exhausted until 2029. As recently as 1996, the Trustees projected the trust fund would be exhausted in 2001. Medicare's annual expenditures are projected to exceed annual income beginning in 2016. Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI-also known as Part B) is financed out of general revenues.

<p>The report suggests that the need for reform is becoming more urgent. Acting on a recommendation by a panel of experts, the Trustees decided to forecast a significantly higher rate of increase for medical costs in the future. Medicare officials had been assuming that health care costs would increase at about the same rate as overall economic growth. The Trustees are now assuming that health care costs will increase at the rate of growth, plus one percentage point.

<p>The Bush Administration has promised to issue a set of principles on Medicare reform within a few weeks. The principles are expected to include creation of a prescription drug benefit. Senators John Breaux (D-LA) and Bill Frist (R-TN) have introduced two bipartisan Medicare reform bills that would add universal prescription drug coverage and provide a competitive system.  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-IA) has predicted that the Senate would pass a Medicare reform bill before the August recess.
