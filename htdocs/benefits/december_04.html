<b>IRS Notice 2004-79 Clarifies Working Families Tax Relief Act Of 2004</b>

<p align="justify">The Internal Revenue Service has published a Notice regarding the recent modification of the definition of “dependent” in the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004. Under the Act, a “qualifying child” is a child, stepchild, sibling or the descendent of any of these, who lives more than half of the taxable year with the taxpayer and has not yet reached a specified age (unless fully disabled). A “qualifying relative” is a person other than a qualifying child who resides over half the time with the taxpayer, receives over half of his or her support form the taxpayer, and whose gross income is not more than the Code § 151 exemption. This change modifies the eligibility of some domestic partners and same-sex spouses to be considered “dependents.”  

<p align="justify">The Notice serves, however, to create an exception from the new definition for “dependents” as regards Section 106 (no taxability of premiums for employer-provided health insurance). Therefore, while the definition remains unchanged in relation to Section 106 as well as Section 105, several retirement benefits as well as dependent care assistance plans can be affected.

<p align="justify">Dependent care assistance benefits will be tax free only if the dependent is a “qualifying child” or “qualifying relative” as described in the WFTRA. Plan documents, policies and procedures will have to be changed to reflect this. Contrary to some expectations for the Notice, these changes are indeed required by January 1, 2005.

<p><b>Group Health Coverage For Armed Services Members Extended</b>

<p align="justify">December 10<sup>th</sup> saw the enactment of language that extends the continuation group health coverage requirements in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act of 1994 from 18 to 24 months. This extension is available for employees electing coverage on or after the December 10<sup>th</sup> effective date. Also in the new law is a requirement for employers to provide an annual notice of USERRA rights and obligations to affected employees. This requirement can be met by a general posting at the workplace.

<p><b>HHS Task Force Reports On Prescription Drug Import Options</b>

<p align="justify">A task force of 12 officials from Health and Human Services has concluded that a national system of importing prescription drugs from Canada or other countries would not net significant overall savings. The report also focused on safety, cautioning against personal importation from any countries other than Canada via the Internet or telephone. In a cover letter to House Speaker Hastert and Senate President Pro Tem Frist, HHS Sec. Thompson and Commerce Sec. Evans warned that Congress should only consider commercial importation possibilities and that legislation should disallow mail-order personal importation. The report also expressed concerns over the indirect effects that drug importation could have on pharmaceutical R&D budgets, due to lower profit margins.

<p><b>Hyde-Weldon Amendment Signed Into Law December 8<sup>th</sup></b>

<p align="justify">On December 8<sup>th</sup> President Bush signed into law an amendment to the Omnibus Appropriations Bill which allows health care entities to refuse to comply with existing regulations on abortion services. With “health entities” very broadly defined to include insurance companies and HMOs, the law allows for organizations to decide against providing services, from full information about options for unwanted pregnancies to abortions themselves. Of concern to pro-choice activists is the language allowing for this decision to be made on the basis of “conscience,” on a corporate level, rather than specific religious beliefs. Also of great concern is the effect that this legislation will have on an already spotty nationwide patchwork of counties and communities in which women have access to abortion services.

<p><b>Hawaii Supreme Court Upholds ERISA Preemption, Even "Implied"</b>

<p align="justify">Although provided for in the Patient Bill of Rights and Responsibilities in that state, the Hawaii Supreme court ruled in November that patients will no longer have the right to appeal a denial of treatment before a panel external to the carrier. In a case involving the reimbursement of attorney fees to a litigant against the Hawaii Management Alliance Association, an HMO, the high court overturned the decisions of two lower state courts.

<p align="justify">Citing two US Supreme Court decisions, the Hawaii Supreme Court stated that although certain state laws which regulate insurance should not be expressly preempted by ERISA, and that the right to external review could be considered such a law, the law shall be seen as preempted because: 

<blockquote><b>A:</b> HMAA is not an insurance company regulated under Hawaii’s insurance code, but rather, as an HMO, both an insurer and a provider.</blockquote> 

<blockquote><b>B:</b> The law, HRS § 432E-6, is impliedly preempted because it conflicts with ERISA’s civil enforcement scheme, even though it “regulates insurance.”</blockquote>

<p align="justify">Some in Hawaii are concerned that the preemption of this law will make consumers much less likely to appeal denials of treatment, as legal costs and limitations to awards (no more than the monetary value of the benefit denied) make litigation a much less attractive medium for appeals.
