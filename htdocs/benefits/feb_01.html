<b>Flurry Of New Regulations Issued, Some Then Postponed</b> 

<p>In it final days, the Clinton administration issued a number of regulations affecting employee benefit plans. Almost immediately after the inauguration on January 20, 2001, the Bush administration placed a moratorium on regulations that had not yet gone into effect.

<p><i>HIPAA Nondiscrimination Provisions</i>

<p>On January 8, 2001, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services published two sets of regulations related to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. An interim final regulation covers the nondiscrimination provisions based on health factors. A proposed regulation deals with bona fide wellness programs. The new regulations clarify that a group health plan may not refuse to provide benefits because an individual is not actively at work on the day the individual would otherwise become eligible for benefits. Prior regulations made it clear that plans cannot exclude people who engage in certain high-risk activities, such as bungee jumping. The new regulations clarify that expenses related to injuries sustained in high-risk activities can be excluded.

<p><i>Transfer of Surplus Pension Assets to Provide Retiree Medical Coverage</i>

<p>On January 9, 2001, the Internal Revenue Service published proposed regulations related to Internal Revenue Code Sections 401(h) and 420, which govern the transfer of surplus pension assets to provide retiree medical coverage. The proposed regulations relate to the "minimum cost requirement" for transfers. Employers would not meet the minimum cost requirements if there is a decline in participation of 10% in a year due to employer action.

<p><i>COBRA</i>

<p>On January 10, 2001, the Internal Revenue Service published final COBRA regulations that adopt the 1999 proposed regulations and make certain changes to the final regulations published in 1999. These regulations clarify a controversial provision in the 1999 regulations. Those rules said that an employer had to allow employees at least 30 days to pay any COBRA premiums that were underpaid by an "insignificant" amount. The new regulations now define "insignificant" as no more than $50 or 10% of the premium, whichever is less. The new regulations also clarify the rules for offering COBRA to qualified beneficiaries who move outside the coverage area of their plan. The preamble to the regulations says that a plan is under no obligation to incur "extraordinary costs" to provide alternative coverage.

<p><i>Cafeteria Plans</i>

<p>On January 10, 2001, the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations relating to Section 125 cafeteria plans. These rules clarify the circumstances under which a cafeteria plan may permit an employee to change his or her cafeteria plan election during the plan year. Participants can now increase or decrease group-term life insurance and/or disability benefits when any change of status occurs.

<p><i>Transportation Plans</i>

<p>On January 11, 2001, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations regarding qualified transportation fringe benefits. For 2001, employees may receive, on a pretax basis, up to $180 per month for commuter parking and up to $65 per month for transit or vanpool expenses. The new regulations also provide some clarification of the rules related to transit system vouchers.

<p><i>The Moratorium</i>

<p>On January 20, 2001, Andrew H. Card, Jr., the White House Chief of Staff wrote to the heads and acting heads of executive departments and agencies asking them to temporarily postpone for 60 days the effective date of regulations that had not yet taken effect. Legal experts disagree as to exactly which regulations are affected by the moratorium. As we understand it, the administration could withdraw regulations entirely, but cannot modify them without going through the process of publishing changes and taking public comments. Our future bulletins will provide more details on these regulations as they become effective.
