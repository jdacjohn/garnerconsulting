<b>IRS Rules On Automatic Cafeteria Plan Elections</b>

<p align="justify">On May 20, 2002, the Internal Revenue Service published Revenue Ruling 2002-27, in which it said that cafeteria plans may use an automatic enrollment process. Under an automatic enrollment process, an employee's salary is reduced each year to pay for a portion of the group health coverage under the plan, unless the employee affirmatively elects cash.

<p align="justify">The ruling addresses two common plan design features: negative (automatic) elections and evergreen clauses. The ruling makes it clear that automatic elections are allowed, provided employees receive adequate notice of the automatic enrollment process and their right to decline coverage. Employees also must receive information on the procedure for declining coverage and information about when the election must be made and how long it will be in effect.

<p align="justify">Interestingly, the Revenue Ruling uses an example in which it says an election "is effective if made when the employee is hired or within a reasonable period ending before the compensation for the first pay period is currently available." Except for special enrollment periods for birth or adoption, the IRS has previously prohibited retroactive elections. This ruling appears to permit new hires to make elections retroactively, provided the election is made before the first payday.

<p align="justify">The ruling also makes it clear that evergreen clauses are allowed. Under an evergreen clause, an election made for any prior year carries over to the next succeeding plan year unless changed. This is consistent with informal guidance from the IRS in the recent past.

<p align="justify">The ruling also addresses the potential impact of automatic elections on the definition of compensation for pension plans if employees are not given an option to decline coverage.

<p><b>CMS Makes HIPAA Extension Form Available Electronically</b>

<p align="justify">The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has made a form available to obtain an extension to comply with the electronic transaction regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The form is available at:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.cms.gov/hipaa/hipaa2/ASCAForm.asp" target="_blank">http://www.cms.gov/hipaa/hipaa2/ASCAForm.asp</a></blockquote>

<p align="justify">If covered entities file a compliance plan with CMS by October 16, 2002, the new deadline is October 16, 2003. The form on the web site can be printed, completed and mailed to CMS or it can be submitted electronically. Covered entities may also submit their own version of a compliance plan that provides equivalent information. CMS does not need to approve the compliance plan; merely submitting the form qualifies a covered entity for the extension.

<p align="justify">The Administrative Simplification Compliance Act, signed last December, implied that the compliance plan would need to include an analysis of the extent to which the covered entity is not in compliance, the reasons for non-compliance and a budget, schedule or workplan or other implementation strategy. In contrast with the statute, the model form does not require the covered entity to state the extent to which it is currently noncompliant. The reason the covered entity needs an extension can simply be that it needs more time. The model form simply requires a statement as to whether a workplan exists, not that one be submitted. Instead of requiring a budget, the model form simply requires a statement of aggregate costs. Rather than requiring an implementation strategy, the form simply requires that dates be assigned to three phases (awareness, assessment and development).

<p align="justify">Every health plan (which includes medical, dental, vision, healthcare spending accounts and some employee assistance programs) is a covered entity and should file an extension form if it will not be in compliance with the electronic transaction regulations by October 16, 2002. The instructions for the form say that multiple related covered entities that are operating under a single implementation plan can file one form. "Related" is not defined. It is unlikely that a third-party administrator could file one form on behalf of all of its clients.

<p><b>California Law On Social Security Numbers</b>

<p align="justify">California SB 168, enacted last year, prohibits certain uses of Social Security numbers, including printing an individual's Social Security number on any card required for the individual to access services. The law is effective July 1, 2002, but delayed effective dates apply to HMOs, insurance companies and prescription drug plans.

<p align="justify">The May 13, 2002 issue of <i>Business Insurance</i> included an article about this new law and included the following regarding the question whether ERISA pre-empts the law:

<blockquote>"If I were a self-funded plan, or representing a self-funded plan, I would argue that pre-emption applies, but I wouldn't take it to the bank," said John C. Garner, chief executive officer of Pasadena, Calif.-based Garner Consulting. "It depends on how aggressive the employer wants to be."</blockquote>

<p align="justify">Legislation (SB 1730) has been introduced to clarify that self-funded plans have the same delayed effective dates as HMOs, insurance companies and prescription drug plans.
