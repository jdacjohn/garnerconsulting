<p><b>Terrorist Attacks To Affect Benefits</b>

<p>The unfortunate events of this month will have a number of results in the field of employee benefits. Many of the effects will be in the political realm, but benefit professionals will have to deal with a number of administrative issues as well.

<p><i>Political Issues</i>

<p>Suddenly, the passage of a patients' bill of rights or Medicare reform have been pushed lower on the Congressional agenda. Congress still needs to pass appropriations bills before October first (although continuing resolutions could keep the government running on a temporary basis.) There is a good chance that a bill to extend the Mental Health Parity Act will be attached to an appropriations bill. Without such a bill, the Mental Health Parity Act will expire at the end of September. If such a bill is passed, it could expand the requirements of the Mental Health Parity Act.

<p><i>Form 5500s</i>

<p>On September 14, 2001, the U.S. Department of Labor's Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration announced an extension of the deadline for filing Form 5500s for employee benefit plans affected by the national disaster.

<p>The extension applies to plan administrators, employers and other entities who file the Form 5500 that are located in the areas designated as federal disaster areas because of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The extension also applies to filers located outside the designated disaster areas who are unable to obtain the information necessary for filing from service providers, banks or insurance companies whose operations are directly affected by the disasters.

<p>Under the extension, those with filings originally due between September 11, 2001, and November 30, 2001, will be allowed an additional six months plus 120 days to file. Filers currently on an extension that expires between September 11, 2001, and November 30, 2001, will be allowed an additional 120 days to file. Filers who have difficulty in meeting filing deadlines because of disruption of transportation and delivery of documents by mail or private delivery service resulting from the disasters, and who do not otherwise qualify for the extensions described above, will have until November 15, 2001 to make their Form 5500 filing. Please note that these extensions cannot be extended further by filing a Form 5558.

<p>Filers entitled to the extension relief described above should check Part 1, Box D, on the Form 5500 and attach a statement labeled "SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACK" that explains the basis for the extension being claimed under this release. Filers who have additional questions may contact the PWBA Help Desk at 1-866-463-3278.

<p><i>USERRA</i>

<p>Employers will need to comply with the requirements of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA). Generally, USERRA requires that if an employee takes military leave and is reemployed within five years after the date the leave began, the employee is entitled to seniority and the benefits that the employee would have had without the leave.

<p>USERRA gives employees rights to continue health care benefits. Individuals on leaves less than 31 days can only be required to pay the same amount as active employees. Employees on longer leaves can continue coverage for 18 months from the date leave begins and can be required to pay 102% of the plan's cost. COBRA regulations state that the COBRA and USERRA continuations run concurrently, not consecutively. One of the differences between COBRA and USERRA is that USERRA continuation coverage does not terminate when someone becomes covered under another group health plan.

<p>Since employees must have their benefits reinstated when they return to work, no waiting periods or pre-existing conditions exclusions can apply (unless such a period applied when the employee went on leave, in which case it would resume.) Employers can exclude service-related conditions.

<p>The Department of Labor has a description of USERRA at its website: <a href="http://www.dol.gov/elaws/USERRA0.htm" target="_blank">http://www.dol.gov/elaws/USERRA0.htm</a>

<p><i>War Exclusions</i>

<p>At press time for this bulletin, there had been no reports of any insurance companies denying claims under war exclusions.
