<b>HHS Publishes Final Privacy Regulations</b> 

<p>On December 28, 2000 the Department of Health and Human Services published in the <i>Federal Register</i> standards for protecting the privacy of personal health records. These new regulations are intended to protect medical records and other personal health information maintained by health care providers, health insurers, HMOs and health care clearinghouses.

<p>The new standards:

<ul type="square">
<li>limit the non-consensual use and release of private health information;</li>
 
<li>give patients new rights to access their medical records and to know who else has accessed them;</li>
 
<li>restrict most disclosure of health information to the minimum needed for the intended purpose;</li>
 
<li>establish new criminal and civil sanctions for improper use or disclosure; and</li>
 
<li>establish new requirements for access to records by researchers and others.</li>
</ul> 

<p>The final regulations apply to personal medical records in all forms -- including paper records and oral communications. The earlier proposal had applied only to electronic records.

<p>The final rule also requires that most providers get their patients' consent for routine use and disclosure of health records, in addition to requiring their authorization for non-routine disclosures. The earlier version had proposed allowing routine disclosures without advance consent.

<p>Another change from the proposed rule relates to protecting medical records from unauthorized use for employment purposes. Companies that sponsor health plans will not be able to access personal health information from the plan for employment-related purposes, without authorization from the patient.

<p>The new regulations reflect the following basic principles:
 
<ul type="square">
<li><b>Consumer Control:</b> The regulations provide consumers with new rights to control the release of their medical information. This includes advance consent for most disclosures of health information; the right to see a copy of their health records; the right to request a correction to their health records; the right to obtain documentation of disclosures of their health information; and the right to an explanation of their privacy rights and how their information may be used or disclosed.</li></ul>

<ul type="square"> 
<li><b>Boundaries:</b> With few exceptions, an individual's health care information should be used for health purposes only, including treatment and payment. For example, a hospital may use personal health information to provide care, teach, train, conduct research and ensure quality. However, employers who also sponsor health plans may not obtain information for non-health purposes like hiring, firing or determining promotions, without permission from the individual. Similarly, insurers may not use such information to underwrite other products, such as life insurance. Disclosure is to be kept to the minimum information needed for the purpose of the disclosure.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">  
<li><b>Accountability:</b> For the first time, there will be specific federal penalties if a patient's right to privacy is violated. For non-criminal violations of the privacy standards by the persons subject to the standards, including disclosures made in error, there are civil monetary penalties of $100 per violation up to $25,000 per year, per standard. In addition, criminal penalties are provided for certain types of violations of the statute that are done knowingly: up to $50,000 and one year in prison for obtaining or disclosing protected health information; up to $100,000 and up to five years in prison for obtaining or disclosing protected health information under "false pretenses;" and up to $250,000 and up to 10 years in prison for obtaining protected health information with the intent to sell, transfer or use it for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm.</li></ul> 

<ul type="square">
<li><b>Public Responsibility:</b> The new standards attempt to reflect the need to balance privacy protections with the public responsibility to support such national priorities as protecting public health, conducting medical research, improving the quality of care, and fighting health care fraud and abuse. For example, when there is an infectious disease outbreak, public health agencies need to obtain important information to better protect the public. The new regulations provide standards for how such information should be released to balance privacy and public health needs.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li><b>Security:</b> It is the responsibility of organizations that are entrusted with health information to protect it against deliberate or inadvertent misuse or disclosure. The final regulations require covered organizations to establish clear procedures to protect patients' privacy, including designating an official to establish and monitor the entity's privacy practices and training.</li></ul> 

<p>In circumstances where the federal rules and state laws are in conflict, the stronger privacy protection will prevail. The standards apply to all consumers whether they have insurance or are uninsured or are covered by governmental programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Most covered entities will have until February 26, 2003 to come into compliance.

<p>The final regulations only apply to health plans and do not regulate life, disability or worker's compensation programs. The penalties do not create a private right of action.
