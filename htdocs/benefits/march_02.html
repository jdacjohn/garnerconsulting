<b>Supreme Court Rules On FMLA Notice Penalty</b>

<p align="justify">On March 19, 2002, the U. S. Supreme Court issued its first ruling interpreting the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). In <i>Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc.</i>, the court struck down a portion of the regulations governing FMLA.

<p align="justify">The FMLA statute does not require an employer to notify an employee if a particular episode of leave will count as FMLA leave, but the regulations do have a notice requirement. The regulations provide that if the notice is not given, the leave will not count as part of the maximum FMLA leave of 12 weeks.

<p align="justify">In this case, the employer did not give the notice, but argued that the notice requirement in the regulations went beyond the law and was therefore invalid. The Supreme Court did not strike down the notice requirement, but did agree with the employer that the remedy for the failure to provide the notice should be tailored to the circumstances.

<p align="justify">Therefore, while this case is generally good news for employers, employers should still make every effort to comply with the notice requirement in the regulations.

<p><b>HHS To Propose Revisions To Privacy Regulations</b>

<p align="justify">On March 21, 2002, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Tommy G. Thompson proposed changes to HHS' health privacy regulations to correct unintended consequences that threatened patients' access to quality health care.

<p>The proposal would make the following revisions:

<ul type="square">
<li><b>Remove consent requirements hindering access to care.</b> As written, the privacy rule's general requirement that patients give prior consent to the use and disclosure of protected health information before receiving treatment created serious unintended consequences that interfere with patients' access to health care. For example, patients could be required to visit a pharmacy in person to sign paperwork before a pharmacist could fill their prescriptions. Similar barriers could arise when a patient is referred to a specialist and in other situations. In addition, doctors could refuse to treat patients who refused to sign their privacy consent form. To fix these problems, the proposal would promote access to care by removing the consent requirements for treatment, payment, and health care operations that could interfere with efficient delivery of health care. Patients would be asked to acknowledge the privacy notice, but doctors and other providers could treat them if they did not.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li><b>Allow treatment-related conversations.</b> By covering oral communications and limiting the use of personal health information to the "minimum necessary," the privacy rule raised concerns that routine conversations between doctors and patients, nurses and others involved in a patient's care could violate the rule. This could stifle essential communication necessary to provide the highest quality care possible. The proposed changes would continue to cover oral communications and maintain the "minimum necessary" requirement, but would make clear that doctors could discuss a patient's treatment with other doctors and professionals involved in their care without fear that their conversations could lead to a violation. As long as a covered entity met the minimum necessary standards and took reasonable safeguards to protect personal health information, incidental disclosures - such as another patient hearing a snippet of conversation - would not be subject to penalties. Improper disclosures would still violate the rule.</li></ul>

<p>The proposal also would make other revisions to simplify the rule's paperwork requirements.  For example:

<ul type="square">
<li><b>Provide model business associate provisions.</b> The existing rule requires covered entities -- health plans, health care providers and clearinghouses -- to have contracts with their business associates to ensure that they follow the privacy rule's requirements. The proposal includes model business associate contract provisions. The changes also would give covered entities up to an additional year to change existing contracts, easing the burden of renegotiating contracts all at once.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li><b>Simplify authorizations.</b> The changes would allow the use of a single type of authorization form to obtain a patient's permission for a specific use or disclosure that otherwise would not be permitted under the rule. Patients would still need to grant permission in advance for each type of use or disclosure, but the proposal would eliminate the need to use different types of forms to obtain that advance permission.</li></ul> 

<p align="justify">The proposed changes are scheduled to be published in the Federal Register the week of March 25, 2002, with a 30-day comment period. HHS will consider public comments on the proposed changes before issuing a final rule.
