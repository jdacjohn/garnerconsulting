<b>CMS Proposes Regulations On Medicare</b>

<p align="justify">On August 3, 2004, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) published proposed regulations implementing the new Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). The MMA specifies that the prescription drug benefit program will become available to beneficiaries beginning on January 1, 2006.

<p align="justify">Consistent with the MMA, this proposed rule provides for subsidy payments to sponsors of qualified retiree prescription drug plans. Subpart R of the proposed regulations covers provisions for making retiree drug payments (subsidies) to sponsors of qualified retiree prescription drug plans.

<p align="justify">In order to qualify for the subsidy a plan must satisfy the definition of actuarial equivalence.  Actuarial equivalence refers to a determination that, in the aggregate, the dollar value of drug coverage for a set of beneficiaries under one plan can be shown to be equal to the dollar value for those same beneficiaries under another plan.

<p align="justify">Although the statute sets forth specific requirements for actuarial equivalence and valuation, there is no formal definition of actuarial equivalence. CMS expects to provide additional guidance in the future on these provisions.

<p align="justify">Subsidy payments will be exempt from Federal tax. Further guidance on the Federal tax treatment of the subsidy will be under the auspices of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

<p align="justify">MMA provides sponsors of retiree prescription drug plans with multiple options for providing drug coverage to their retirees. The intent of these options is to encourage employers and unions to continue to assist their retirees in having access to prescription drug coverage.

<p align="justify">Generally, employers and unions that offer drug benefits to their retirees (and dependents) who are also eligible for Medicare Part D could:

<ul type="square">
<li>Provide prescription drug coverage through employment-based retiree health coverage. If employment-based retiree health coverage is at least actuarially equivalent to the standard prescription drug coverage under Medicare Part D, the sponsor would be eligible for a special Federal subsidy for each individual enrolled in the sponsor’s plan who is also eligible for Medicare Part D, but who elects not to enroll in Part D.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Contract with a private prescription drug plan (PDP) sponsor or Medicare Advantage (MA) organization to enroll Medicare beneficiaries covered under the retiree plan into a PDP or MA-prescription drug (MA-PD) plan. Alternatively, the sponsor itself could apply to be a PDP sponsor or MA organization and offer a PDP or MA-PD plan to its retirees. That plan could consist of enhanced alternative coverage, that is, drug coverage that is more generous than that offered under the standard prescription drug coverage under Part D. Medicare would subsidize the cost of such coverage through direct and reinsurance subsidies. At its option, the sponsor could elect to subsidize the monthly beneficiary premium.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Provide prescription drug coverage that supplements or wraps around the coverage offered under the PDP or MA-PD plans in which their retirees (and dependents) enroll.</li></ul>

<p align="justify">Only costs paid by a Part D enrollee would count toward the annual out-of-pocket threshold as “true out-of-pocket expenditures” (TrOOP). Employers or unions who sponsor supplemental coverage that would wrap around Part D coverage would raise the total drug spending that would trigger government-financed catastrophic coverage, since drug costs paid for by those plans would reduce beneficiary costs and would not count toward the TrOOP.

<p align="justify">The subsidy payment made to a sponsor of a qualified retiree prescription drug plan would be based on actual drug spending by individuals enrolled in the plan and not premium payments. The subsidy is 28% of certain costs that are incurred for certain prescription drugs for individuals covered under the qualified retiree prescription drug plan who are eligible for Part D but who are not enrolled in Part D. The sponsor must submit an actuarial attestation that its plan is at least actuarially equivalent to the standard Part D benefit.

<p align="justify">The statute specifies that the subsidy may be made only for those costs that fall between the cost threshold and the cost limit. For 2006, the cost threshold is $250 and the cost limit is $5,000. In other words, the first $250 in prescription drug costs for an individual during a year and any prescription drug costs for that year that exceed $5,000 is disregarded for purposes of calculating the subsidy. The dollar values for the cost threshold and cost limit will be adjusted annually.

<p align="justify">In order to receive the subsidy, plans must be able to provide data on drug costs for each covered retiree and dependent. There will be no subsidy for retirees or dependents who have costs up to $250. For covered individuals with drug costs over $250, the subsidy will not apply to the first $250 of costs. The subsidy will not apply to drug costs over $5,000. Therefore, the maximum subsidy for a covered individual will be $1,330, which is $5,000 minus $250, times 28%. CMS estimates that the average retiree drug subsidy amount will be $611; since that is tax-free, it is equivalent to about $940 of taxable income for employers with a marginal tax rate of 35%.
