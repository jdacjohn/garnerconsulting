<p><b>California Issues Paid Family Leave Regulations</b>

<p align="justify">On June 23, 2004, California’s Employment Development Department filed Family Temporary Disability Insurance (also known as paid family leave) regulations with the Secretary of State. The regulations clarify a number of issues, including:

<ul type="square">

<li>The statute requires a claimant to establish that a serious health condition warrants the participation of the employee. The regulations clarify that providing reassurance and emotional support that is beneficial to a child, spouse, parent or registered domestic partner with a serious health condition qualifies for paid family leave.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Claimants are entitled to six weeks of paid family leave in a 12-month period. The regulations give examples of how the 12-month period works. One example given is that a claimant provides care for a parent from November 17, 2004 through December 14, 2004, then provides care for a spouse beginning November 3, 2005. In this example, three weeks of care are considered to be waiting periods. A separate seven-day waiting period applies to each individual for whom care is provided. Because the care for the spouse extends beyond the initial 12-month period, another waiting period is required at the beginning of the second 12-month period (November 17, 2005 in this example).</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>The regulations also clarify that a claimant who serves a waiting period on her State Disability Insurance pregnancy claim is not required to serve an additional waiting period for paid family leave. This means that women generally will not need to satisfy the waiting period to have bonding time with newborns, but that men will need to do so.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>The regulations also clarify that bonding time need not be at home. The example given is for twins born seven weeks premature who must remain in a neonatal care unit. A claimant could visit the twins there and still have the time qualify for paid family leave. Another example is of a claimant who bonds with a new child via live remote camera; the regulations state this arrangement does not constitute bonding within the context of the paid family leave program.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Under the regulations, partial days absent from work count as full days for purposes of satisfying the waiting period. The regulations also clarify that the waiting period need not be met with consecutive days of absence. For example, if an employee needs to take off one day a month to take a parent to a medical appointment, the first seven months will count as waiting period, but one day in each of the next five months will qualify for benefits under the paid family leave program.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>The regulations also give examples regarding receipt of regular wages and vacation pay. The fact that someone is receiving regular wages or vacation pay does not preclude days from counting toward the waiting period, but paid family leave benefits are not payable for days when regular wages are paid. Employers may require employees to take up to two weeks of vacation in conjunction with paid family leave. The first week counts as waiting period, but no paid family leave benefits are available during the second week. However, if an employer does not require an employee to take two weeks of vacation, an employee can choose to take vacation and can also receive paid family leave benefits for the same week.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>The statute provides that a child includes a child of a person standing <i>in loco parentis</i>. The regulations clarify that the definition is applicable regardless of age or dependency status. The regulations also clarify that “<i>in loco parentis</i>” exists when a person undertakes care and control of a child in the absence of such supervision by the natural parents and in the absence of formal legal approval. This includes persons with day-to-day responsibilities to care for and financially support a child. It also includes the person who had such responsibility for the employee when the employee was a child. A biological or legal relationship is not necessary.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>An individual is not eligible for paid family leave on any day that another family member is ready, willing and able and available to provide care during the same period of time in a day that the individual is providing care. Therefore, if a brother is not willing to provide required care, an employee is entitled to paid family leave. Another example in the regulations says that if the brother is an unemployed substance abuser and the parent does not want the brother to provide care because of his unreliability, that the employee can receive paid family leave benefits.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Only one care provider may claim benefits for providing care in any 8-hour period and no more than three may claim benefits for a 24-hour period. If three children are providing care to a parent who needs 24-hour care, all three may claim benefits, but if a doctor says only eight hours of care a day are needed, only one can claim benefits for any given day.</li></ul>
