<b>MEDICARE Changes Announced</b>

<p align="justify">The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has announced the annual Medicare changes for 2003, which include the following:

<ul type="square">
<li>The inpatient hospital deductible will be $840 for the first 60 days, up from $812 in 2002;</li>

<li>The daily coinsurance amount for the 61<sup>st</sup> through 90<sup>th</sup> days of hospitalization in a benefit period will be $210 (1/4 of the inpatient hospital deductible);</li>

<li>The daily coinsurance amount for lifetime reserve days will be $420 (1/2 of the inpatient hospital deductible);</li>

<li>The daily coinsurance amount for the 21<sup>st</sup> through 100<sup>th</sup> days of extended care services in a skilled nursing facility in a benefit period will be $105 (1/8 of the inpatient hospital deductible);</li>

<li>The Part A monthly premium will be $316, down from $319 in 2002 for one person who has fewer than 30 quarters of Medicare-covered employment and $174, down from $175 in 2002, for one person who has 30 to 39 quarters of Medicare-covered employment.</li>

<li>The Part B monthly premium will be $58.70, up from $54 in 2002.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>HIPAA Enforcement</b>

<p align="justify">On October 15, 2002, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) will create a new department, specifically devoted to enforcement of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and other related regulations. CMS will be responsible for enforcing the transaction and code standards for electronic data interchange (EDI) as part of the portability requirements. The Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) will enforce the privacy standards. HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson noted:

<p style="padding-right:25; padding-left:30" align="justify">HIPAA administrative simplification is going to streamline and standardize the electronic filing and processing of health insurance claims, save money and provide better service for providers, insurers and patients. To accomplish this will require an enforcement operation that will assure compliance and provide support for those who file and process health care claims and other transactions. CMS is the agency best able to do this.

<p align="justify">CMS’s new department will also reach out to various covered entities to help them comply with the new requirements. Unless an extension was filed by October 15, most covered entities were to be in compliance with the electronic regulations by October 16, 2002. Small health plans do not need to comply until October 16, 2003 (and do not need to have filed an extension). “Small health plan” is defined as one with receipts of less than $5,000,000 a year; “receipts” is generally interpreted as premiums for an insured plan and claims for a self-funded plan.

<p><b>Changes To Indexed Limits Do Not Affect Welfare Plans</b>

<p align="justify">The IRS has announced cost-of-living adjustments for 2003. Limits will remain the same for welfare plans, including the following:

<ul type="square" style="padding-right:6">

<li>Section 416(i) - the compensation limits used to determine who is a key employees remains unchanged.</li>

<li>Section 414(q) - compensation used in the definition of highly compensated remains $90,000.</li>

<li>The annual compensation limit for benefits provided through Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Associations remains at $200,000.</li>

</ul>
