<strong>Congress Softens Borders For Canadian Drug Importation</strong>

<p align="justify">On September 22, House and Senate Republicans came to an agreement that will allow Americans to bring in up to a 90-day supply of medication from Canada without being stopped by customs agents.</p> 
 
<p align="justify">The deal resolved a controversy between House Republican leaders and other GOP Representatives. The split, with leaders on one side concerned about drug safety, and rank-and-file Republicans on the other who want to offer voting seniors a cheaper option for their prescriptions, had held up the Homeland Security Department’s appropriations bill for several days. The deal that was reached allows for people to carry in a small amount of Canadian prescription drugs themselves, but still prohibits Internet or mail purchasing.</p>  

<p align="justify">The US Customs and Border Protection Agency announced on October 5<sup>th</sup> that they will stop intercepting mail order prescriptions as well, a policy that has been in effect for 11 months. Instead of intercepting and destroying legitimate, but Canadian, prescriptions, the agency will focus on finding and destroying counterfeit drugs. Some note that this move comes at about the time when many seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D are reaching the “donut hole” and are looking forward to paying for their prescriptions out of pocket for a time, perhaps the rest of 2006.</p>  

<p><strong>Massachusetts Town, Illinios Dump (ON) Canadian Rx Programs</strong></p>

<p align="justify">While Congress and the US Customs Agency have been loosening up on Canadian prescriptions, the town of Springfield, MA and the state of Illinois are realizing with disillusionment that Canadian drugs have not been the panacea they hoped for rising health care costs. Springfield, which had created its own health insurance plan that included Canadian drug reimportation, had decided to end the plan and enroll workers and retirees in the state’s health plan.</p> 
 
<p align="justify">Illinois’s I-SaveRx plan, meant to bring down prescription costs, did not look good in the light of the auditor general’s report, which stated that the plan has so far only served 3,700 people, and has cost $1 million. The Governor, Rod Blagojevich, has vowed to maintain the plan, and even extend it to all state employees, but many wonder whether the plan is worthwhile.</p>  

<p><strong>Schwarzenegger Vetoes Two Health Care Bills</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On September 22<sup>nd</sup>, California Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, vetoed a bill to create a statewide single-payer health care system. Stating that “socialized medicine is not the solution,” the governor said he “won’t jeopardize the economy of our state for such a purpose.” Asserting that his health care summit in July was the beginning of his own moves to restructure the health care system in California, Schwarzenegger said also that he will present his own reform plan soon. It will rely on participation from both the government and the private sector, he said.</p>  

<p align="justify">Schwarzenegger also vetoed California’s version of the Wal-Mart bill, which would require large employers to spend at least 8% of payroll costs on employee health benefits, or pay the difference into state health care funds. The governor said that the bill would do nothing to lower costs or expand coverage.</p>
  
<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> US Circuit Court Oks Bonus Cuts Due To Leave</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On September 15 the 3<sup>rd</sup> US Circuit Court of Appeals was the first federal appellate court to consider the issue of whether companies can cut bonuses of employees who have been off work on medical leave. Judge Ruggero Aldisert ruled that this is allowed, but continued to state that bonus plans must be written with specific productivity or working hours criteria for earning bonuses.</p> 
 
<p align="justify">The court rejected the plaintiff’s argument that his employer had acted improperly in cutting his bonus after he took leave under FMLA. The appellate court upheld a lower court ruling that the employee is not entitled to accrue any rights of employment which would have been accrued if the employees were not on leave. Since the bonus plan in question was based on presence at work and set a target of 1,950 hours of work as the threshold for a full bonus, the court ruled that the employer was in the right in this case.</p> 

<p><strong>Another Court Weighs In On The Accidental Nature Of Drunken Dying</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On September 1 the US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan ruled that MetLife was arbitrary in denying a woman accidental death benefits because her son was drunk when he died in a car crash. Nancy Lennon’s son, David, had a blood alcohol level three times higher than the legal limit for driving at the time of his death, according to the medical examiner. MetLife argued that the death was not accidental, since the injuries leading to death were caused by overconsumption of alcohol, and were therefore “self-inflicted.”</p>  

<p align="justify">The court ruled that MetLife was capricious in calling Lennon’s death non-accidental, stating that “the relevant inquiry is not whether a reasonable person views death as a highly likely or inevitable consequence of drunk driving,” pointing out that “the drunk driver does not necessarily expect to die.” The decision is one more in a series representing a split in the courts as to whether intoxicated deaths are accidental.</p>  

<p><strong>Pension Protection Act Of 2006 Signed Into Law</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On August 15 President Bush signed the Pension Protection Act into law. Most of the provisions relate to retirement plans; provisions relating to health and welfare plans include:</p>

<ul type="square">
<li>For plan years beginning after 2007, Form 5500s must be filed with the Department of Labor (DOL) in an electronic format.  The DOL will post the filings on the Internet.  If the plan sponsor maintains a web site for communicating with employees, the plan sponsor must post the same information there.</li>
<li>The Act also amends the rules regarding the transfer of excess pension assets to retiree medical accounts to allow funding of estimated future costs.</li>
<li>The Act also amends Internal Revenue Code Section 419A to allow certain associations to take tax deductions to fund medical benefits for future years.</li>
<li>The Act also removes the tax advantages of corporate-owned life insurance unless the insured has given consent to the arrangement.</li>
</ul>
