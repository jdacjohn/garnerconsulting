<strong>SOME PROGRESS ON HEALTH CARE COMPROMISE BILL</strong>

<p align="justify">After long negotiations, a compromise health care bill, hammered out by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Legislative Democrats, made it out of committee and was passed by the Assembly on December 17.  ABx11 currently calls for universal coverage, covering more Californians than the original Democratic plan.  That means it will cost more, and the Democratic leaders propose putting a $1.50 to $2-per-pack cigarette tax on next year's ballot to help fund the program.  The plan also requires employers to spend between 1% and 6.5%, calculated on a sliding scale, of payroll costs on health care, or pay into a statewide insurance pool. </p>

<p align="justify">The legislation will have to pass the Senate next year, as well as gain approval from voters.  With the plan estimated to cost $14 billion, and an expected budget shortfall for 2008 of $14 billion, the bill's chances are still questionable</p>



<strong>SF HEALTH CARE MANDATE FOUND IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW</strong>

<p align="justify">In a case brought to US District Court by the Golden gate Restaurant Association, Federal Judge Jeffrey White ruled on December 26 that the mandate portion of the Healthy San Francisco health care plan violates federal law.  The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) pre-emtps state laws that relate to employee benefits, although states are allowed to regulate insurance.  </p>


<p align="justify">San Francisco's mayor, Gavin Newsom, expressed displeasure with the decision, and said that he is committed to covering more San Fransiscans, even if the process may take longer due to this ruling.  "We are undeterred," he said.  City Attorney Dennis Herrera announced a plan to seek a stay of the decision while his office appeals.  </p>

<strong>COURT REDUCES COBRA AWARD FOR FIRED WORKER</strong>

<p align="justify">The US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York ruled on December 14 that a New York man was entitled to $10 per day from his former employer for COBRA violations, not $110 per day.  The employer had claimed that COBRA eligibility was denied due to gross misconduct, and the court ruled that the employer had failed to sufficiently show that the misconduct had been that grave.  </p>


<p align="justify">The court noted that the "Notice of Ineligibility for COBRA Continuation Coverage" sent to the former employee did not uphold the accusation of gross misconduct, as it merely stated the reason that he was ineligible to be "due to your employment status code."  For this reason the court decided to grant some recompense, but not the full amount allowable by law, nor any legal fees related to pursuit of denied claims.  Legal fees for the lawsuit regarding the COBRA notification would have been awarded, but the plaintiff's lawyer had not properly itemized billable hours.  </p>

<strong>CONGRESS APPROVES EXTENSION OF MHPA</strong>

<p align="justify">On December 19, Congress passed legislation that extends the Mental Health Parity Act through the end of 2008.  The extension does not make any changes to the law, despite efforts to change the fact that higher copayments, coinsurance and deductibles are still allowed for mental health services.  </p>

<strong>SENATE AND HOUSE PASS EXTENSION FOR SCHIP</strong>

<p align="justify">On December 18 the Senate approved legislation that extends the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) through March 2009.  On December 19 the House passed the legislation as well.  With these votes the intense battle with George W. Bush, who twice vetoed bills that would have expanded the program significantly, came to an end for the time being.  Many would like to see the program cover more children, but for now, the program will not sunset.  `</p>


<strong>NO ERISA BREACH FOR HONEST MISTAKE</strong>



<p align="justify">The US District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled on December 4 that a company that accidentally sent forms to the wrong address did not commit a fiduciary breach under ERISA.  Though the company sent the forms for conversion of a group life insurance plan to the office where the former employee had previously worked, rather than his home, the court found that the mistake was a "slight ministerial error" rather than a breach of fiduciary duty.  The case was brought to court by the employee's family, when he died nine months after his termination from the plan.  </p>


<strong>DON'T CUT WORKER'S COMP DUE TO AGE, SAYS COURT</strong>



<p align="justify">A California Appeals Court ruled on December 5 that it is illegal to reduce a worker's comp benefit due to age.  In a case involving a 73-year-old worker injured on the job, the court ruled that it is not legal to reduce her benefit by any percentage if the reason for the reduction is a result of age.  In this case, the medical examiner found that her disability was due in part to pre-existing conditions, osteoporosis and age.  These conditions are not valid reasons for exclusion, the court said, because they are directly related to age.  </p>



<strong>CBA DOES NOT PROMISE FREE RETIREE COVERGAE, RULES COURT</strong>

<p align="justify">The US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio ruled on November 29 that retirees who relied on a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) to assure them that they would never have to pay for retiree health care had no leg to stand on.  Citing a paragraph in the agreement that said "employees . . . will receive a full company contribution towards the cost of [health] benefits," the court said that there was no contractual obligation to pay all costs.  </p>
