<b>President Signs Extension Of Mental Health Parity Act</b>

<p align="justify">On December 2, 2002, President Bush signed the Mental Health Parity Reauthorization Act of 2002. This new law extends the Mental Health Parity Act through 2003.

<p><b>New Guidance Released On HIPAA Privacy Regulations</b>

<p align="justify">On December 3, 2002, the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services released guidance in the form of questions and answers regarding the privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The guidance covers a number of subjects, including:

<ul type="square">
<li>Incidental Uses and Disclosures</li>
<li>Minimum Necessary</li>
<li>Personal Representatives</li>
<li>Business Associates</li>
<li>Uses and Disclosures for Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Public Health</li>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Workers’ Compensation Laws</li>
<li>Notice</li>
<li>Government Access</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">Most of the guidance pertains to health care providers, but there are a number of items that relate to health plans and plan sponsors. For example, the guidance clarifies that it is not necessary for a health plan to have a business associate contract with the plan sponsor, provided that the health plan’s documents have been amended to limit disclosures. The guidance also clarifies that a business associate contract is not required with persons or organizations such as janitorial services or electricians whose functions or services do not involve the use or disclosure of protected health information and where any access to protected health information would be incidental, if at all. The relationship between a group health plan and a health insurer or HMO does not require a business associate contract, according to the new guidance, because the covered entities participate in an organized health care arrangement (OHCA). Furthermore, a health plan that purchases reinsurance does not need a business associate contract with the reinsurer.

<p align="justify">The guidance states that health plans are not required to provide privacy notices to dependents. Covered entities that participate in an OHCA may use a single, joint notice that covers all the participating covered entities.

<p align="justify">The guidance also clarifies that the privacy rule itself does not require business associates to appoint a privacy officer, distribute privacy notices or develop policies and procedures for use and disclosure of protected health information, although covered entities may require their business associates to do so under the terms of their contracts.

<p align="justify">The guidance also makes it clear that covered entities may use “layered” notices, in which a short notice briefly summarizes the individual’s rights and other information and a longer notice beneath the short notice contains all the elements required by the privacy rules.

<p align="justify">The questions and answers also make clear that contracts that automatically renew are eligible for the transition period if the contract existed by October 15, 2002.

<p align="justify">The guidance also addresses what constitute appropriate safeguards when faxing protected health information. Covered entities must have reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the privacy of health information. Examples of measures that could be reasonable and appropriate include confirming the fax number before sending a fax and placing the fax machine in a secure location to prevent unauthorized access.

<p><b>Health Care Reform Debate Heats Up</b>

<p align="justify">As the number of uninsured begins to increase again and health care costs continue to escalate, discussion of universal coverage is also becoming more common. Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) said on November 21, 2002 that he plans to propose that employers with five or more employees pay for 75% of the cost of health insurance. In December, Bruce Bodaken, CEO of Blue Shield of California proposed a “play-or-pay” model of universal health insurance, in which all but very small employers would be required to provide health insurance to employees or pay into a fund that would provide coverage.

<p align="justify">The election of Senator Bill Frist (R-TN) as Senate Majority Leader is also likely to move health care reform to the forefront of the legislative agenda. Senator Frist is the only Medical Doctor in the Senate. In the past, Senator Frist has been an advocate of using tax credits to decrease the number of uninsured. He also favors a fundamental restructuring of Medicare by increasing its reliance on private insurance companies. He would like to convert Medicare from the existing approach under which Medicare pays doctors directly to one in which Medicare beneficiaries would receive a fixed amount to purchase private insurance from an approved insurer. Similarly, like most congressional Republicans, he favors providing prescription drugs to senior citizens through private insurers.
