<b>Senate Passes Mental Health Parity Bill</b>

<p>On November 7, 2001, the U. S. Senate passed H.R. 3061, an appropriations bill for fiscal year 2002. The bill would revive and expand the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996. The 1996 law expired at the end of September 2001. The new law would be effective January 1, 2003. As under the old law, the new law would exempt employers with 50 or fewer employees and would not apply to substance abuse treatment. Unlike the old law, the Senate-passed version would require full parity between mental health benefits and benefits for medical and surgical treatment.

<p>Previously, as part of its version of the economic stimulus package, the House voted to extend the old law by two years. A conference committee will attempt to resolve differences between the two bills. It is quite likely that Congress will act soon, but it is unclear which version will become law.

<p><b>Health Insurance Assistance Stalled In Senate</b>

<p>Senate Democrats have failed to gain approval for their economic stimulus package. The Senate Democratic package would have provided $12.3 billion for unemployed workers to buy COBRA coverage, among other provisions. Senate Republicans have indicated they are working on their own package, which reportedly is similar to the one passed by the House in October.

<p>The House bill includes $3 billion in block grants for states to provide health insurance for unemployed workers. The House bill also includes a provision that expands the exemption from the 10% early withdrawal tax to include distributions from qualified plans and IRAs used to pay health insurance expenses for unemployed individuals. The measure also contains a provision that would extend the medical savings account (MSA) demonstration project through December 31, 2003.

<p>Democrats argue that the Republican plan does not provide adequate funding to address the needs of displaced workers. One option for compromise may be to allow displaced workers a tax credit that could be used to purchase COBRA or individual insurance, which is often less expensive, particularly for high-deductible coverage.

<p><b>Bill Introduced To Delay Administrative Simplification</b>

<p>On November 14, 2001, Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) introduced S. 1684 to extend the deadline for compliance with the administrative simplification provisions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

<p><b>HMSA Announces Refunds</b>

<p>The Hawaii Medical Service Association (the Blue Cross/Blue Shield affiliate in Hawaii) has announced that it will refund some premiums to group policyholders because Hawaii has been so severely affected by the reduction in travel following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Employers need to remember that if any employee contributions helped pay for the premiums, the Department of Labor considers a proportionate amount of the refund to be plan assets, which must be used for the benefit of plan participants.

<p><i>Garner Consulting can assist in the determination of whether a refund constitutes a plan asset and, if so, what proportion.</i>

<p><b>IRS Increases Allowance For Mileage</b>

<p>The Internal Revenue Service has announced that the mileage rate for business travel will increase to 36.5 cents per mile, effective January 1, 2002. This rate is used as an alternative to deducting actual costs. The rate for medical travel and moving expenses increases from 12 cents to 13 cents. The rate for travel for charitable services remains 14 cents.

<p><b>MEDICARE Prescription Drug Card Moving Forward</b>

<p>On November 5, 2001, a federal judge lifted a preliminary injunction that had stopped the Bush Administration's plans to create a new Medicare discount drug card program. The injunction had been granted in September. Groups who contended that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) lacked the statutory authority to implement the program had sought the injunction. The November order allows CMS to proceed with notice and comment on the proposed new program.

<p><b>Demonstration Project For Families Of Reservists</b>

<p>On November 5, 2001, the Department of Defense announced that it is implementing a demonstration project to address unreasonable impediments to the continuity of health care encountered by family members of activated reservists and National Guardsmen.
