<strong>Final Rules Issued Under HIPAA On Wellness Plans</strong>

<p align="justify">The Departments of Treasury, Labor and Health and Human Services issued final rules for nondiscrimination and wellness programs on December 13, 2006. Good news to employers who want to provide employees with incentives for healthy behavior, the new rules apply to health plans with plan years beginning on or after July 1, 2007.</p>

<p align="justify">The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) prohibits discrimination in health coverage based on a health factor. The new regulations finalize both the 2001 interim rules, addressing many issues, and the 2001 proposed rules, which specifically address wellness programs.</p>

<p align="justify">In general, the new regulations do not change the rules, but provide clarification, most significantly regarding wellness incentive programs.</p>

<p align="justify">HIPAA nondiscrimination provisions generally prohibit plans from charging similarly situated individuals different premiums based on a health factor. These final regulations also generally prohibit plans from requiring similarly situated individuals to satisfy different cost-sharing requirements. However, HIPAA does not prevent a plan from establishing premium discounts or rebates or modifying otherwise applicable copayments or deductibles as a reward for members who adhere to health promotion and disease management programs.</p>

<p align="justify">Many wellness programs will not have to satisfy any additional requirements under the regulations because the reward is not related to a health factor. Examples are: reimbursements for fitness center memberships, reimbursements for smoking cessation programs (without regard to outcome), and those which reward members who participate in health risk assessments, without regard to results.</p>

<p align="justify">Only programs under which any of the conditions for obtaining a reward is based on an individual satisfying a standard related to a health factor must meet the five additional requirements described below.</p>

<ol>
<li>The total reward that may be given to an individual for all wellness programs is limited. The final regulations set the limit on rewards at 20% of the total cost of coverage. If dependents can participate in the wellness program, the limit is based on the cost of the coverage category in which the employee and any dependents are enrolled.</li>

<li>The program must be reasonably designed to promote good health or prevent disease.</li>

<li>A program must give individuals eligible for the program the opportunity to qualify for the reward at least once per year.</li>

<li>A wellness program that provides a reward requiring satisfaction of a standard related to a health factor must provide a reasonable alternative standard for obtaining the reward for certain individuals. This alternative standard must be available for individuals for whom, for that period, it is unreasonably difficult due to a medical condition to satisfy the otherwise applicable standard, or for whom it is medically inadvisable to attempt to satisfy the standard. A program need not set the alternative standard before the plan begins; determining a reasonable alternative standard once a participant informs the plan of the need for it is sufficient.</li>

<li>All plan materials describing the terms of the program must disclose the availability of a reasonable alternative standard.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>FMLA Does Not Require Continuous Service</strong></p>

<p align="justify">In December, the 1<sup>st</sup> US Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston ruled that a person does not need to work 12 consecutive months before becoming eligible for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). In a case involving an employee who had been employed for five years, had terminated employment, and then had returned to work for seven months before taking medical leave, the court ruled that the employee’s subsequent termination was not upheld by the statute.</p>  

<p align="justify">Regulations issued by the Department of Labor (DOL) establish that previous periods of employment count toward the 12 months. The court held that FMLA is ambiguous as to whether previous periods of employment count toward the 12-month requirement, but that the regulations establish a reasonable interpretation of the statute and that the regulations are a reasonable exercise of the DOL’s authority.</p>

<p><strong>Appeals Court Rejects Maryland’s Fair Share Law</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On January 17 the 4<sup>th</sup> US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Maryland Fair Share Act, which was passed last year despite the governor’s veto, is pre-empted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Because the law, which forces employers with more than 10,000 employees to spend a specific percentage of payroll on medical benefits, would force multi-state employers to restructure employee benefit plans, the court ruled that it conflicts with ERISA’s goal of supporting uniform administration of plans, the court stated.</p>

<p><strong>Arkansas Creates Health Plan For Small Businesses</strong></p>

<p align="justify">In December, Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee announced a plan to use tobacco settlement funds and federal funding to create a system of subsidies for small employers. In exchange for help in funding health care plans for workers whose annual household income is 200% or less of the federal poverty level, employers will commit to covering their entire workforce.</p>  

<p><strong>Another Court Weighs In On Drunkenness And Accidental Death</strong></p>
 
<p align="justify">The US District Court for the Middle District of Florida ruled in December, 2006, that a man paralyzed in a drunk-driving accident could be held responsible for his injuries, and that the accidental death and dismemberment insurer was correct in denying the man benefits. While there were disputes as to whether the man was actually driving the car, and whether hospital staff members were responsible for his injuries, the importance of the decision rests on the distinction that the injury was self-inflicted. Stating that, though it was clear that he had not crashed his car on purpose, the accident was self-inflicted because he chose to drive while intoxicated, the court’s opinion became another in the multiplicity of conflicting opinions published in the past year.</p>
