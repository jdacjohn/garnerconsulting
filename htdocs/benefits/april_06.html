<b>Massachusetts Passes Health Coverage Mandate, Far Reaching Plan</b>

<p align="justify">Faced with a federal deadline to address the large number of uninsured in the state by July or lose $385 million in Medicaid funding from the feds, Massachusetts has passed a bill that includes several plans and is thought to be able to cover 90% to 95% of the state's 550,000 uninsured by 2009. The Massachusetts Senate passed the bill unanimously, while the House passed it in an overwhelming vote of 155 to 2.</p> 
   
<p align="justify">A combination of added state spending, tax incentives, insurance subsidies, expanded government insurance programs, and shifting state spending from emergency care into health care coverage, the bill earns Massachusetts entry into a select group of states that are trying to attain universal coverage. Hawaii is the only state with an exemption from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) that allows it to require employers to provide health insurance. Even with this requirement, the number of uninsureds there has been rising. Maine also has a program designed to achieve universal coverage, but it has been struggling.</p> 
 
<p align="justify">Including a controversial clause requiring that uninsured individuals purchase policies (at a minimum those approved by the state and deemed "affordable"), the bill features graduated penalties for those who fail to comply. It also includes penalties for companies with 11 or more employees which fail to provide employees with health coverage and for those whose employees make frequent use of emergency care. For those "free riders," employers would have to pay between 10% and 100% of all costs above $50,000.</p> 
 
<p align="justify">It also focuses on creating affordable coverage by increasing access to Medicaid for some families, subsidizing private health insurance and creating a large pool of insureds which small employers would be able to access.</p>
  
<p align="justify">Challengers, including business groups, say that the bill does not include enough funding and that missing language, for example the definition of "affordable" health plans, could lead to inordinately strict or complicated mandates. It also includes increases in Medicaid rates for hospitals and doctors, which is considered supportive to the status-quo. Hospital representatives counter that this increase is a necessary catch up measure for hospitals that in many cases have been accepting reimbursements below the cost of services rendered.</p>  

<p align="justify">Governor Romney signed the bill into law on April 12, but vetoed eight sections of the bill. Most importantly, he struck the $295 per employee fee for employers who fail to provide coverage. Leaders of both legislative houses stated that they plan to overturn any changes Romney makes to the bill. House Speaker Salvatore DiMasi criticized the vetoes as disingenuous and potentially unbalancing to the bill. "To change anything will disturb the delicate balance that made this law possible," he said. Both houses have Democratic majorities; Governor Romney is a Republican.</p>  
 
<p><strong>Arkansas District Court Rules SPD Does Not Replace Plan Document</strong></p>

<p align="justify">In late March the US District Court for the Western District of Arkansas ruled that a clause which was included in a group health plan's Summary Plan Description (SPD) is unenforceable without corresponding language in the plan document. The group health plan sued an employee for reimbursement of benefits paid when that employee received a large settlement in relation to the accident which caused the claim. The plan cited language in the SPD that gave the plan rights to be reimbursed, but the Court found that this language was not backed up in other plan documents.</p> 

<p align="justify">The Court referred to the employer's "wrap-document" (which covers several benefits programs), which said that the SPD would be considered part of the plan document only if there were no separate plan document or if the SPD described benefits as they are set forth in an insurance policy or contract. In this case, there was no evidence that there was any insurance policy or contract that included a clause about third-party liability reimbursements.</p>

<p><strong>Employer Ruled Not Culpable In Late Distribution Of SPD</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The US District Court for the Eastern District of New York ruled in February that an employee of the Visiting Nurse Service could not recover long-term disability benefits despite the fact that her employer distributed the plan's SPD tardily.</p>  

<p align="justify">After being injured in 1998 and attempting to work a modified schedule, the employee filed for benefits in 2001, when she was first given an SPD for the plan. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurer and the employer, stating that even though the employee received the SPD late, she still did not file her claim within 30 days of receiving the SPD. Thus, even if the SPD distribution date were taken as the first possible date for the filing of a claim, the employee did not abide by the 30 day deadline for claim filing.</p>

<p><strong>MetLife Upheld In Denying Benefits Due To Intoxication</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin ruled in March that MetLife was justified in denying accidental death benefits in a case in which the insured's death was due to alcohol intoxication.</p> 
 
<p align="justify">The insured's wife claimed that it was not known that her husband's death was caused by intoxication, but in the absence of any witnesses, the court decided that the coroner's assessment of the situation seemed reasonable and reliable.</p>  

<p align="justify">The insured was found in his car in a lake near his hotel, to which he had driven after drinking in a bar with a friend.  He dropped off the friend to check in and was not seen again.  Due to his blood alcohol level of .24 and the location of the lake at the edge of the hotel parking lot, the coroner believed that the man had driven his car into the lake, put the car into park and fallen asleep.  The plaintiff's theory that the car had rolled into the lake would seem to be contradicted by the fact that the car was in park.</p>
