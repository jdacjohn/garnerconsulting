<strong>IRS Releases 2007 Limits and Mileage Allowance</strong>

<p align="justify">The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced cost-of-living increases to the dollar limitations on the salaries of highly compensated and key employees. These limitations are used in discrimination testing for Section 125 plans. These are $100,000 for a highly compensated employee, and $145,000 for an officer of a company, as well as $150,000 for a 1% owner of a company.</p>

<p align="justify">In addition, the minimum deductibles for health savings account (HSA) compatible health plans have been set for 2007 at $1,100 for single coverage and $2,200 for family coverage. The maximum contributions to an HSA are limited to the lesser of the deductible or $2,850 for single coverage, and $5,650 for family coverage. The out-of-pocket limits for HSA-compatible plans have been set for 2007 at $5,500 and $11,000 for single and family coverage, respectively.</p> 

<p align="justify">The IRS has set the business-related mileage reimbursement rate at $0.485 per mile and the reimbursement rate for personal mileage at $0.20 per mile.</p>

<p><strong>California Announces State Disability Insurance Rate For 2007</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On November 6, 2006, the California Employee Development Department released the new SDI contribution rate for 2007. The rate is set at 0.6% for 2007, a reduction from the 2006 rate of 0.8%.</p>

<p><strong>Decline In Coverage Largely Due To Employer Sponsorship Gap</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On October 20, 2006, the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured issued a report stating that almost half of the decline in employer-sponsored health insurance coverage was due to employers ceasing to sponsor health care. One quarter of the decline was attributable to loss of eligibility on the part of the employee and one quarter was due to employees waiving coverage.</p>

<p align="justify">The decline, from 81.2% of employees covered in 2001 to 77.4% in 2005, is also affected by workforce changes. Between 2001 and 2005, 5.1 million workers left the workforce and another 1.4 million became unemployed against their will. More workers belong to families living below the poverty level than in 2001 and more workers are self-employed, work part-time, or are working for small businesses. Finally, the increased cost sharing passed on to workers through requiring contributions that are a percentage of premiums (which are rising) led more workers to decline coverage altogether.</p>

<p><strong>Health Care Costs Pinching Personal Pockets</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The 2006 Health Confidence Survey was released on October 25, 2006 by the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI). According to the survey, 36% of respondents said that increasing health care costs are biting into funds which would otherwise be saved for retirement. Employer-sponsored health care is seen as an important tool in fighting the increase in personal health care costs, and workers said they would not want to trade $6,700 worth of health benefits for the equivalent amount of cash. Respondents also stated that they are trying to cut costs by choosing generic drugs, taking better care of themselves, and discussing treatment options with their doctors.</p>

<p><strong>Model Shows Mixed Results For CDHC Effectiveness</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On October 26, 2006, the Journal of Health Affairs published an article on studies conducted using the RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) results to simulate the effects of a shift from employer-sponsored health care to consumer-driven health care (CDHC). According to the studies, this change would bring a reduction in health care spending of 4% to 15%. The pairing of health plans with an HSA or health reimbursement arrangement (HRA), however, is predicted to reduce the savings by half.</p>

<p align="justify">The study authors state that the current short-term results show that the RAND HIE is correct in concluding that CDHCs will reduce consumer utilization and spending. However, the HIE found that both necessary and unnecessary care is reduced. Other studies, however, show that there is increased use of preventive care services and increased compliance with treatment plans with consumer driven health care members.</p>

<p><strong>Hospital System Favors Employers Who Insure</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The Baptist Health South Florida hospital system announced on October 31, 2006, that the system would be giving priority to vendors who provide health care to their employees, over employers who don’t. The system already favors local vendors, and will now favor those who sponsor health care when all other factors are equal. It is possible that in some instances, such vendors will also be paid a higher price.</p>

<p align="justify">The fact that the system had to write off $363 million in charges for charity care and uncompensated services last year was a factor in the decision.</p>

<p><strong>Utah Helps Employees Pay For Employer-Sponsored Care</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The Utah Department of Health announced on November 1, 2006, that the state is rolling out a new program that will help with premiums for employer-sponsored care. Replacing a previous program which subsidized adults’ premiums at a lower rate, the Utah Premium Partnership for Health Insurance program will pay monthly assistance of up to $150 per adult and $100 per child.</p>

<p align="justify">Workers qualify for the program if they are a US citizen or legal resident, are not currently insured but can enroll in an employer-sponsored plan, and meet certain household income guidelines. The program is currently limited to the first 1,000 individuals who enroll, but legislators will consider expanding the program based on interest.</p>

<p><strong>NY Court Of Appeals Forces Religious Groups To Cover Birth Control</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On October 23, 2006, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that a group of church-affiliated nonprofit employers must provide coverage for contraception as a part of their prescription drug coverage. The court stated that the charities did not qualify as religious employers under the state’s Women’s Health and Wellness Act. To be exempted from the requirement to provide contraceptive coverage, the employers would have to exist in order to promote their faiths, employ only or mostly individuals who subscribe to the religious beliefs, and primarily serve individuals who share the same values.</p>

<p align="justify">The opinion noted that religious organizations that hire non-believers should “be prepared to accept neutral regulations imposed to protect those employees’ legitimate interests in doing what their own beliefs permit.”</p>
