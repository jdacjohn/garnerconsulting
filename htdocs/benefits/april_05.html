<b>Supreme Court Expands Age Bias Litigation Possibilities</b>

<p align="justify">The Supreme Court ruled on the 30<sup>th</sup> of March that age discrimination need not be deliberate for employers to be held liable. In a case of 30 police officers against the City of Jackson, MS, the court ruled against the plaintiffs, but for the allowance of so-called “disparate-impact” cases. Already allowed under title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the court ruled to allow cases of this nature based on age as well as sex, religion or race.

<p align="justify">Although this ruling allows for claims against employers whose policies unintentionally have a greater impact on older workers, it does try to strike a balance, with Justice Stevens’ opinion stating that in some instances an employer would be allowed to treat workers differently on the basis of age - as long as there is a “reasonable” motivation for the disparate treatment. Workers now have an easier time bringing such suits to court, but the bar is still very high for them to win against their employers.

<p><b>Federal Court Says ADEA Applies to Retiree Health Benefits</b>

<p align="justify">The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has been banned by a US district court from publishing and putting into effect its proposed rule to exempt retiree health care plans from the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The case was brought to the court by the AARP, which argues that the provision of differing health care benefits for Medicare-eligible and younger retirees amounts to age discrimination.

<p align="justify">The EEOC, which had initially enforced a similar ruling of August 2000, discontinued enforcement after business and labor groups decried the risk that employers would drop retiree health coverage entirely, rather than bring plan design into compliance. The judge in the case, Anita Brody, stated that she was not able to consider this potentiality, but rather had to rule based on the clear intent of Congress, as interpreted by the Third Circuit Court. The EEOC is planning to appeal the decision.

<p><b>Medicare Trustees’ Report Shows No Significant Change</b>

<p align="justify">The 2005 annual report on the state of Medicare shows no significant change, and actually shows a slight improvement on one front. The Hospital Insurance fund is projected to be exhausted in 2020, one year later than projected in the 2004 report. On the other hand, last year this same fund’s expenditures began to exceed its cash revenues, not a good sign.

<p align="justify">Medicare Part B spending is up, and experts look to the new benefits, which emphasize preventive health care, to help mitigate this trend in the future. This portion of Medicare, along with Part D, the new prescription drug benefit, will remain financially solvent, however, because it’s financing is adjusted each year to anticipate cost increases.

<p><b>Association Health Plan Bill Passes In Committee</b>

<p align="justify">The administration-backed bill to allow small businesses to form interstate associations in order to purchase group health coverage has cleared the US House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Similar to an earlier bill which passed the full house in May 2004, this bill has the support of the Republican majority as well as the Executive branch. Most major health insurance groups oppose the bill, while other industry groups, such as the Self-Insurance Institute of America support the bill.

<p><b>HHS Gives HIPAA Security Rule Guidance</b>

<p align="justify">On March 24<sup>th</sup> the Department of Health and Human Services released number three in a series of seven planned papers on the implementation of the HIPAA security rule. This guidance comes less than a month before the April 20<sup>th</sup> compliance date for most covered organizations. Small health plans have an additional year to come into compliance.

<p align="justify">The guidance addresses physical security safeguards. This paper, along with its two antecedents, is available under <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/hipaa/hipaa2" target="_blank">www.cms.hhs.gov/hipaa/hipaa2</a>.
