<b>Claritin Clarification</b>

<p align="justify">Effective December 14, 2002, the allergy medication Claritin no longer requires a prescription. The Food and Drug Administration has approved Claritin (loratedine) as an over-the-counter (OTC) product.

<p align="justify">Many consulting firms and pharmacy benefit managers that should know better have been suggesting to clients that it may be more cost effective to begin covering certain OTC drugs under their health plans. The rationale behind this thinking is that patients may switch from Claritin to other allergy products that still require a prescription in order to have only a copayment, rather than pay the full out-of-pocket cost of an OTC drug.

<p align="justify">The problem with this idea is that it may endanger the tax-preferred status of a health plan. Section 105 of the Internal Revenue Code states that gross income does not include amounts received by an employee under a health plan if amounts reimbursed by the plan would be deductible under Section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 213(d) defines medical expenses and that definition specifies that drugs must require a prescription by a physician (except for insulin). Since OTC drugs do not require a prescription, covering OTC drugs under a health plan calls the tax-preferred status of the plan into question. It is possible that the IRS would consider only reimbursements for OTC drugs to be taxable, which would represent an accounting hardship for the plan. It is also possible that the IRS would disqualify the entire plan and consider all claims paid to be taxable.

<p><b>Revenue Ruling On COBRA For Divorced Spouses</b>

<p align="justify">On December 30, 2002, the Internal Revenue Service published Revenue Ruling 2002-88 in Internal Revenue Bulletin 2002-52 regarding COBRA for divorced spouses. The IRS held that if an employee eliminates coverage of a spouse under a group health plan in anticipation of a divorce, the plan is required to make COBRA continuation coverage available to the spouse as of the date of the divorce. This holding is consistent with the latest COBRA regulations.

<p><b>PWBA Issues FAQs About Benefits For Reservists</b>

<p align="justify">On January 13, 2003, the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (PWBA) released frequently asked questions regarding benefits for employees called to active duty. The FAQs are a good reminder of an employer’s obligations to reservists. COBRA requires employers to provide group health plan continuation benefits to employees and their families who would otherwise lose group health coverage due to a reduction in hours. HIPAA gives special enrollment rights under group health plans to employees when an employee loses coverage under another plan.

<p align="justify">Employers also need to comply with the requirements of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA). Generally, USERRA requires that if an employee takes military leave and is reemployed within five years after the date the leave began, the employee is entitled to seniority and the benefits that the employee would have had without the leave.

<p align="justify">USERRA gives employees rights to continue health care benefits. Individuals on leaves less than 31 days can only be required to pay the same amount as active employees. Employees on longer leaves can continue coverage for 18 months from the date leave begins and can be required to pay 102% of the plan’s cost. COBRA regulations state that the COBRA and USERRA continuations run concurrently, not consecutively. One of the differences between COBRA and USERRA is that USERRA continuation coverage does not terminate when someone becomes covered under another group health plan.

<p align="justify">Since employees must have their benefits reinstated when they return to work, no waiting periods or pre-existing conditions exclusions can apply (unless such a period applied when the employee went on leave, in which case it would resume.) This rule can present significant problems under voluntary life and disability plans. For example, if an employee with employee-pay-all life and disability benefits elects not to continue paying premiums while on active duty and suffers a disability that precludes him or her from satisfying any evidence of insurability requirements upon return from military leave, the employer becomes self-funded for the voluntary life and disability benefits, because USERRA requires that employers reinstate coverage. Therefore, Garner Consulting suggests that employers continue premium payments for voluntary benefits that are subject to evidence of insurability for employees called to active duty.

<p align="justify">Employers can exclude service-related conditions under group health plans, but the exclusion must be clearly stated in the plan document and summary plan description.
