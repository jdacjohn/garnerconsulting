<b>U.S. Supreme Court Complicates Third-Party Reimbursement</b>

<p align="justify">On January 8, 2002, the United States Supreme Court issued a ruling that will make it more difficult for health care plans to recover costs under third-party reimbursement and subrogation provisions. The case is <i>Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company v. Knudson</i>.

<p align="justify">The case involved a car accident in 1992 in which Janette Knudson became a quadriplegic. The plan paid $411,157.11 of her medical expenses. Great-West Life paid all but $75,000 under a stop-loss policy. The plan included a reimbursement provision that provided the Plan the right to recover amounts paid by the plan that the beneficiary is entitled to recover from a third party. The plan had a first lien upon any recovery, settlement, judgment or otherwise. The plan also provided that the beneficiary would be personally liable to the plan for amounts paid by the plan and recovered from a third party. The plan assigned to Great-West Life its rights to negotiate a claim under the reimbursement provision.

<p align="justify">The Knudsons filed suit against Hyundai and negotiated a settlement of $650,000. The settlement allocated $373,426 to attorney's fees and costs, $256,745.30 to a special needs trust, $13, 828.70 to Great-West for past medical expenses and $5,000 to reimburse Medi-Cal. Great-West never cashed the check and instead sought injunctive and declaratory relief to force the Knudsons to reimburse the entire amount paid by the plan. The United States District Court for the Central District of California granted summary judgment to the Knudsons on the basis that the plan language limited its right of reimbursement to the amount received for past medical treatment. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed this decision, but on different grounds. The Ninth Circuit held that judicially decreed reimbursement for payments made to a beneficiary of an insurance plan by a third party is not equitable relief and is therefore not authorized by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Section 502(a)(3) of ERISA authorizes a civil action:

<blockquote>By a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates...the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of...the terms of the plan.</blockquote>

<p align="justify">The Supreme Court agreed with the Ninth Circuit's opinion that imposing personal liability for a contractual obligation would constitute "legal" relief, but not "equitable" relief. Therefore, Great-West is unable to pursue claims in federal court under ERISA. It is possible that the Courts might have reached a different conclusion if the money had been in the possession of the defendants.

<p align="justify">It has been a common practice for ERISA plans to seek repayment after a participant obtains a recovery from a third party.  In the future, it may be necessary for plans to take a more proactive role, monitoring cases and negotiating the plan's share of a recovery.

<p align="justify">Plans should review their plan document and summary plan description language in light of this decision. If the documents in this case had allowed the plan to collect from any recipient of settlement proceeds, the decision might have been different.

<p><b>Supreme Court Narrows Definition of Disability Under ADA</b>

<p align="justify">On January 9, 2002, the United States Supreme Court narrowed the definition of disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The case is <i>Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams</i>. Ms. Williams suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome. The court ruled that an individual must be substantially limited in performing major life activities, not just those associated with the workplace.

<p><b>Mental Health Parity Extended</b>

<p align="justify">On January 10, 2002, President Bush signed an appropriations bill that includes a one-year extension of the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996. This bill retroactively extends the sunset date for mental health parity from September, 2001 to December 31, 2002.

<p><b>Electronic Transactions Delayed</b>

<p align="justify">On December 27, 2001, President Bush signed the Administrative Simplification Compliance Act. This act extends for one year the deadline for complying with the electronic transaction regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The new deadline is October 16, 2003, if covered entities file a compliance plan with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) by October 16, 2002. This act calls for HHS to publish a model compliance plan by March 31, 2002.
