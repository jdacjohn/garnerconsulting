<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">The following is a brief summary of some of the new laws affecting life, health and disability insurance in California. Unless otherwise noted, the bills described here apply to contracts issued, amended, delivered or renewed on or after January 1, 2006.

<p><b><i>Transplantation Services: Human Immunodeficiency Virus</i></b>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">AB 228 prohibits HMOs and health insurers from denying coverage for the cost of organ or tissue transplantation services on the basis that the patient is infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. Case management and utilization review procedures are not precluded, so long as they are consistent with the terms and conditions of the policy or contract and with sound clinical processes and guidelines.

<p><b><i>Trust and Custodial Agreements: Credit Unions and HSAs</i></b>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">AB 434 authorizes a state chartered credit union to act as a trustee or custodian under a written trust instrument or custodial agreement created or organized in the United States that is part of an education or medical plan for its members, or groups or organizations of its members, and that qualifies or has qualified under specified sections of the Internal Revenue Code. This bill clarifies the ability of state chartered credit unions to offer Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), as well as education savings accounts.

<p><b><i>Payers' Bill of Rights: Procedure</i></b>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">AB 1045 requires hospitals to compile and submit to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development a list of the average charges for 25 common outpatient procedures. Hospitals must also do the same for the 25 most common inpatient procedures, as grouped by Medicare diagnostic-related groups ("DRG"). These lists will then be posted by the department on the web. Hospitals are also required to provide a copy of the lists to any person upon request.

<p><b><i>Health Care Coverage</i></b>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">AB 1533 impacts both HMOs and health insurance policies, and relates to state law provisions implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act portability rules. By virtue of this bill, an individual, or his or her dependent, who has lost or will lose Healthy Families Program coverage as a result of exceeding the program's income or age limits and who requests enrollment within 30 days after termination of coverage will not have to wait until open enrollment to obtain employer sponsored coverage.

<p><b><i>Transgender Discrimination Prohibited</i></b>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">AB 1586 prohibits health plans and life and disability insurers from denying insurance coverage - including coverage for specific services - solely because the proposed insured is a transgender individual.

<p><b><i>Health Insurance Complaint System</i></b>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">SB 367 requires the Department of Insurance (DOI), on or before July 1, 2006, to establish a web page dedicated exclusively to: (1) processing complaints and inquiries from insureds and their health care providers relating to health insurance issues; (2) providing information concerning the process for filing complaints; and (3) making inquiries concerning health insurers. The bill also requires the DOI to provide announcements regarding the complaint system and begin to process those complaints by that date. In addition, SB 367 requires a health insurer to provide a copy of its notice denying or contesting a provider's claim to each insured who received services. Notices are also required to each provider who provided services. Notices must include a statement of the basis for contesting or denying the claim and that the provider or insured may request review by the DOI. The bill also requires each contract between a health insurer and a provider to provide for a dispute resolution mechanism, and requires the mechanism to be available to non-contracting providers. Annual reports about complaints made to health insurers must be made by insurers to the DOI beginning on July 1, 2007.

<p><b><i>Group Life Insurance</i></b>

<p align="justify">Group life policies can only be issued to groups defined by the Insurance Code. SB 487 expands the list of groups.

<p><b><i>Health Insurance: Claim Practices</i></b>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">SB 634 imposes requirements on health insurers that enter into contracts with health care providers for the processing and payment of claims. These requirements include the disclosure, by the health insurer or contracting agent, of specified information in electronic format to providers annually and, additionally, upon a contracted provider's request. The information to be provided includes the amount of payment for each service to be provided under the contract, including any fee schedules or other factors or units used in determining the fees for each service. SB 634 requires the health insurance policy or self-insured employee welfare benefit plan disclosure forms to insureds and enrollees to contain the nature and extent of the financial liability that is or may be incurred by the insured, enrollee, or his or her family, where care is furnished by a provider that does not have a contract with the insurer or plan to provide services at an alternative rate of payment.

<p><center><b>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</b></center>

<p align="justify"><i>Please remember that Federal law may preempt some of these bills to the extent they attempt to regulate self-funded employee benefit plans. <a href="brokerage.html">Garner Insurance Services</a> does not practice law. Please seek qualified counsel if you need legal advice.  For group insurance brokerage services, please call Zaven Kazazian or Andy Keowen at (626) 440-0399.</i>
