Long-Term Care Coverage <a href="new.html"><img src="new_close.gif" border="0" alt="Close"></a>

<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000">

<b>Is it time to take a look?</b> 

<p style="padding-left:20; padding-right:20" align="justify">Long-Term Care has been on the market for over 20 years. Things have changed a lot in the past two years. Historically, coverage on a group basis has only been available for the largest employers. Individual coverage was originally sold as "Nursing Home Insurance". It is easy to understand, with the old products, why very few individuals or employers had a strong interest in Long-Term Care.
 
<p style="padding-left:20; padding-right:20"><b>Why should individuals and employers consider Long-Term Care?</b> 

<p style="padding-left:20; padding-right:20" align="justify">Today, through advances in medicine and changes in life style, people are living longer. With longer life spans, it is more likely that older Americans will need some assistance during their life in performing the activities of daily living. Many Americans wrongly believe that Medicare will pay the bills for nursing home care, assisted living facilities, or help in continuing to live at home. Unfortunately, in most cases, Medicare will pay very little of the costs associated with the help needed that is provided by Long-Term Care coverage. With the cost of nursing home care at about $45,000 a year in California, many families will have lifetime savings depleted in a nursing home stay of 2-3 years. 

<p style="padding-left:20; padding-right:20"><b>Individual policies have been greatly enhanced to provide broader coverage.</b> 

<p style="padding-left:20; padding-right:20" align="justify">In older policies, benefits were only paid if an individual was confined in a nursing home. In many instances, nursing home confinement is not the best or most cost effective way to help people deal with a temporary or permanent need for help in performing activities of daily living. Policies now provide coverage for home health care, homemaker services, adult day care/social care, hospice services, residential care facilities, as well as nursing facility benefits; and much more. 

<p style="padding-left:20; padding-right:20" align="justify">Individual coverage is based on evidence of good health. For younger people, normally a health question form is all that is required. For older individuals, a phone interview or face to face interview may be required. Rates are based on age of the individual at the time coverage is purchased. Waiting to buy can be costly, not only in higher premiums, but in the fact that health changes may make an individual uninsurable. 

<p style="padding-left:20; padding-right:20"><b>Group coverage is now available to smaller employers.</b> 

<p style="padding-left:20; padding-right:20" align="justify">Smaller employers can now buy coverage on a group basis. For groups over 20-25 lives, coverage does not require individual health questions. Employers can pay part or all of the premium. Coverage is portable, which means the employee can continue coverage upon termination, at group rates that are based on the age of the employee at the time coverage is first started. Coverage is available for spouses and parents, subject to underwriting and health questions. 

<p style="padding-left:20; padding-right:20" align="justify">Premiums for group coverage are very reasonable. Deductibility of employer paid premiums is treated very favorably under current rules. It is likely there may be some change on tax related issues in the future on employer-sponsored group coverage. 

<p style="padding-left:20; padding-right:20; padding-bottom:20" align="justify">For further information on Long-Term Care, contact Andy Keowen at (626) 351-2300 or via <a href="mailto:andy@garnerconsulting.com">e-mail</a>.
