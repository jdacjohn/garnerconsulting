<b>Congress Passes Medicare Bill</b>

<p align="justify">On November 25, 2003, the United States Senate, by a vote of 54-44, passed the most sweeping changes in the history of Medicare. President Bush has pledged to sign the legislation, which has been a centerpiece of his domestic policy agenda. This month’s bulletin will summarize the legislation and next month’s bulletin will provide additional details.

<p align="justify">The most significant part of the bill is the new prescription drug benefit, which will be effective in 2006. There will be a $250 prescription drug deductible, with 75% coverage up to $2,250 in total charges. Medicare will not pay anything after that until an individual’s out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs reach $3,600, at which point Medicare will pay 95% of covered charges. Low-income subsidies will be provided to people earning less than 150% of the federal poverty level. Average premiums for the prescription drug benefit will be about $35 a month. Many people have criticized the large gap in coverage after $2,250 in drug charges.

<p align="justify">The bill also changes the name of Medicare+Choice plans to Medicare Advantage plans. The bill makes the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for assuring that each Medicare beneficiary has available a choice of enrollment in at least two qualifying plans, including at least one prescription drug plan and one Medicare Advantage plan offering prescription drug benefits. If no Medicare Advantage plan is available, then two prescription drug plans must be offered in that area. To increase beneficiary choice in more rural areas, this bill encourages regional plans. 

<p align="justify">The Medicare Advantage program was another controversial element in the legislation. Since the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created the Medicare+Choice program, payment rate changes led to a significant decrease in enrollment in private plans. Enrollment fell from 6.2 million beneficiaries in 1998 to 4.6 million currently. The number of private plans fell from 346 to 155 during the same period. This disruption has been due in part to unpredictable and insufficient payments by the government to the private plans. This part of the Medicare legislation reforms the payment system in 2004.

<p align="justify">A demonstration of comparative cost adjustments in selected sites will begin in 2010. Bids from private plans and rates for traditional fee-for-service Medicare will be averaged to create a benchmark for competitive bidding. The competitive program is intended to encourage beneficiaries to enroll in the most efficient plan, which should produce savings for both beneficiaries and taxpayers. 

<p align="justify">Until the prescription drug benefit becomes available in 2006, a prescription drug discount card will be available, beginning in April, 2004. HHS estimates the savings available through the cards will be between 15% and 25%.

<p align="justify">Group health plans offering actuarially equivalent prescription drug coverage will receive a 28% subsidy from the government. This tax-free subsidy is intended to encourage employers to continue providing prescription drug benefits to retirees. Qualified retiree plans will have maximum flexibility in plan design, formularies and networks. Employers can also provide premium subsidies and cost-sharing assistance for retirees that enroll in Medicare prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans. Employers can also negotiate preferential premiums from Medicare Advantage plans.

<p align="justify">This bill also provides coverage for new preventive benefits, such as screening for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It also creates a disease management program to assist beneficiaries with chronic illnesses. Medicare will also cover an initial voluntary physical exam when becoming eligible for Medicare, subject to deductible and coinsurance.

<p align="justify">The Part B deductible is set at $110 in 2005 and will be indexed to growth in Part B expenditures after that.

<p align="justify">Medicare reimbursements to physicians will be increased in 2004 and 2005, rather than decreased.

<p align="justify">The bill requires the Government Accounting Office (GAO) to conduct a study on access of Medicare beneficiaries to physicians’ services under Medicare. The study will examine the extent to which physicians are not accepting new Medicare beneficiaries as patients. The bill also requires the GAO to study the feasibility and advisability of providing Part B coverage of marriage and family therapist services and mental health counselors.

<p align="justify">The bill does not contain language about retiree medical benefits; however, the conference agreement states, "the conferees reviewed the ADEA and its legislative history and believe the legislative history clearly articulates the intent of Congress that employers should not be prevented from providing voluntary benefits to retirees only until they become eligible to participate in the Medicare program."

<p align="justify">The bill clarifies that employers do not have to provide Form 1099s to service providers if services are paid for with a debit, credit or stored-value card. This clarification should encourage many employers to offer a debit card in conjunction with a flexible spending account or health reimbursement arrangement.

<p align="justify">The bill also creates tax-free Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) for qualified medical expenses. More details will be provided in our December bulletin.
