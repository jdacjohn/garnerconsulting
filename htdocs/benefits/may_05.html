<b>CMS Issues Guidance For Evaluating Retiree Rx Plans For Medicare D Equivalence</b>

<p align="justify">The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' guidance of April 7<sup>th</sup> provides quite a lot of helpful information and tools for evaluating the actuarial equivalence of employer-sponsored retiree prescription drug plans. In addition to narrative explanations, the CMS also provides an Excel spreadsheet with "open source" formulae to explain the mathematics. The spreadsheet is available at <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/medicarereform/pdbma/employer.asp" target="_blank">www.cms.hhs.gov/medicarereform/pdbma/employer.asp</a>.

<p align="justify">The guidance seems to give more room for interpretation to actuaries, who are allowed to use their discretion in the application of plan experience to testing. Among the points of clarification is the fact that employers offering a Part D wraparound plan can consider the reduced value of Part D benefits caused by the wrap-around plan (which would interfere with the true out of pocket requirements for Part D catastrophic coverage) when calculating net values of Part D and employer coverage. Also, averages can be used to determine premiums, and plans do not need to average in reduced premiums when calculating net value.

<p><b>CMS Announces Medicare Part D Resources For Plan Sponsors</b>

<p align="justify">CMS announced May 21<sup>st</sup> that three new resources for plan sponsors considering the effects of Medicare Part D are debuting in June and July of this year. A Retiree Drug Subsidy web site is to be officially launched on June 1, 2005 and will include general information, instructions and assistance for the subsidy application process, as well as regulations, news and upcoming event notices. The first monthly conference call will take place on June 15<sup>th</sup> at 10:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time, and sponsors can easily register for a conference call through the website. Last, CMS will hold a national conference on the Retiree Drug Subsidy in Dallas TX on July 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup>, 2005. A webcast or DVD of the conference will be available for those who cannot attend.

<p><b>Senate Small Business Chair Introduces SIMPLE Cafeteria Plan Act</b>

<p align="justify">Olympia Snow (R, Maine) introduced a bill on April 7<sup>th</sup> which would amend the tax code so that more partnerships, S-corporations and other small businesses would be able to purchase employer-sponsored health insurance with pre-tax dollars. The act would remedy the current exclusion of many small businesses from cafeteria plan sponsorship due to current eligibility rules.

<p align="justify">The measure would also permit employees to carry over unused Flexible Spending Account balances, and simplify the administration of dependent care accounts. Small business and employee benefits associations have worked hard to facilitate the introduction of the measure and expect that it could greatly increase the number of small business employees who are covered by employer-sponsored health plans.

<p><b>IRS Ruling States The Obvious</b>

<p align="justify">In Revenue Ruling 2005-24, the IRS illustrates that Health Reimbursement Arrangements would lose their tax-favored status if employers were to disburse unused balances to employees in any form that could be used for non-qualified expenses. Laying out three possible HRA designs which would do this, the IRS ruling declares that cash payments to employees at the end of the plan year (or at employment termination), cash payments to beneficiaries of deceased employees, and conversion of the funds into retirement savings would all negate the tax-free status of HRA funds. 

<p align="justify">In the same ruling, however, the IRS affirmed that the cash value of a retiree's unused vacation and sick leave may be credited to an HRA tax-free. This can only be done at the time of retirement, and of course the funds could only be used for qualified expenses. 

<p><b>Treasury And IRS Agree On Spouse Contributions To HSAs</b>

<p align="justify">On April 13<sup>th</sup>, the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service issued a joint ruling on a potentially confusing situation involving spouses with differing coverage.  

<p align="justify">In the example cited, the ruling makes clear that an individual is allowed to use a Health Savings Account in conjunction with a qualifying High Deductible Health Plan, even if his or her spouse and children are covered under a different, non-qualifying health plan. The spouse who contributes to an HSA may not be covered by the non-qualifying health plan, however.

<p><b>Treasury Creates Helpful HSA Tri-Fold Brochure</b>

<p align="justify">The Dept. of Treasury has created and published on the web a tri-fold brochure on HSAs which can be freely used duplicated. The brochure is downloadable at <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/public-affairs/hsa/pdf/hsa_tri-fold_brochure.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.treas.gov/offices/public-affairs/hsa/pdf/hsa_tri-fold_brochure.pdf</a>.

<p><b>IRS Budges On "Use It Or Lose It" but New Grace Period For FSAs Causes Some Headaches</b>

<p align="justify">Treasury issued Notice 2005-42 on May 18<sup>th</sup>, which allows plan sponsors to allow for a period of up to 2½ months past the end of the plan year in which to incur FSA-qualified expenses. Treasury Secretary John Snow enthused that the rule will "ease the year-end spending rush" experienced under the prior rule, but administrative, HIPAA and COBRA compliance issues may make the new rule less attractive to many employers than originally hoped. Many proponents of abolishing the use it or lose it rule applaud the move, but continue to root for a more sweeping change. See our June Bulletin for more details.
