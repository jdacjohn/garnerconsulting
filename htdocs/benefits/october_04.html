<b>Working Families Tax Relief Act Of 2004</b>

<p align="justify">On October 4, 2004, President Bush signed the Working Families Tax Relief Act (WFTRA), which is scheduled to go into effect January 1, 2005. WFTRA will change dependent definitions, which will affect dependent care flexible spending accounts and tax exclusions for health plans. The Act defines “dependent” as a “qualifying child” or “qualifying relative”. A qualifying child must meet the following four criteria:

<ul type="square">
<li>For more than half of the taxable year, the child must reside with the taxpayer.</li>
<li>Certain familial conditions must be met (such as, the child is a biological child, grandchild, sibling, etc. of the taxpayer).</li>
<li>The child must be under the age of 19, or 24 if a full-time student, at the end of the year.</li>
<li>The child cannot have provided over half of his or her own support for the year.</li></ul>

<p align="justify">A “qualifying relative” is someone who is not a child, but meets other conditions, such as gross income under a certain level and received more than half of his or her support from the taxpayer.

<p align="justify">One key change is that qualifying relatives are only such if their gross income is less than the amount in Code Section 151 (currently $3,100). Another noteworthy modification is that there is now a statutory age limit for qualifying children. In addition, one does not have to provide more than half of a qualifying child’s support if that child resides with them for more than half the year.
 
<p align="justify">Given the practical considerations of these definition changes, transition relief may be extended beyond January 1.

<p align="justify">WFTRA also extends Medical Savings Accounts (MSA) through 2005. MSAs allow individuals with high-deductible insurance policies to save for medical expenses, with the taxes deferred on the income contributed to the MSA. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) was also extended through 2005; the MHPA prohibits group health plans from imposing dollar or lifetime limits for mental health care that are lower than limits for medical care.

<p><b>New Hawaii Regulations On Self-Funding</b>

<p align="justify">Under Hawaii’s Prepaid Health Care law, companies are permitted to provide benefits as a “self-insurer” pending approval by the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. In order to receive the state’s approval to be a self-insurer, companies must prove that they are solvent and “able to defray or reimburse” the cost of their employees’ health care. The state has now issued guidelines regarding the definition of these conditions.

<p align="justify">Companies can prove their solvency by receiving an “unqualified audit opinion” by an independent CPA. This audit needs to have been performed within a year of seeking self-insurer status from the state.

<p align="justify">The state has established the following five criteria to determine whether or not companies are able to pay for their employees medical costs:

<ol>
<li>The number of employees;</li>
<li>The amount of the company’s available surplus reserves or equity;</li>
<li>The amount of funds deposited on a monthly basis into an account in order to reimburse employee medical costs;</li>
<li>The amount of cash on hand; and</li>
<li>Whether the company has obtained stop-loss protection.</li></ol>

<p align="justify">Each of these five criteria contain further specifications based on the number of employees a company has (fewer than 250 employees, 250-1,499 employees, and greater than 1,500 employees). <i>Please contact Garner Consulting regarding these additional stipulations</i>.

<p align="justify">Other unique circumstances may be taken into consideration as the state determines if a company is qualified to be self-insured. Furthermore, companies will be monitored on an annual basis to ensure that they are able to continue to meet the Solvency and Ability to Pay Rule.

<p><b>Garner Consulting Statement On Insurance Scandal</b>

<p align="justify">As you may be aware there has been considerable media discussion about the manner in which insurance brokers, agents and consultants are compensated by the insurance entities recommended to their clients.

<p align="justify">Garner Consulting and Garner Insurance Services reject the practice of placing business with certain insurers based on their commission structures. Our relationships with insurance carriers are based solely on meeting client needs. If in meeting client needs, we happen to qualify for a marketing bonus, we are pleasantly surprised.

<p align="justify">Unlike some brokers and consultants who only request insurance quotes from a small number of carriers in order to qualify for bonuses from each of them, we work with dozens of carriers. As evidence of this, marketing bonuses represented less than 1% of our total revenue in 2003. According to <i>Business Insurance magazine</i>, only one of the 100 largest insurance brokers in the country reported receiving no such income. Nineteen others could not, or would not, report how much they received. The other 80 brokers reported receiving from 1.0% to 12.0% of total income from such commissions.
