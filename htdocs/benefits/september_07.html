<strong>7th CIRCUIT SAYS FMLA DOESN'T DICTATE WAGE FOR W.C. LIGHT DUTY</strong>

<p align="justify">On August 6, 2007, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) does not dictate the wage rate for an employee while on light duty under a workers' compensation plan.  <em>Hendricks v. Compass Group, USA, Inc., No. 06-3637 (7th Cir., August 6, 2007).</em></p>

<p align="justify">As a utility driver, Hendricks performed maintenance duties and traveled to businesses where Compass Group's vending machines were located in order to fill, repair and clean those machines.  On June 2, 2003, she suffered a rotator cuff injury while at work.  Instead of taking FMLA, she elected to take light duty under her workers' compensation program.</p>

<p align="justify">While on light duty, Hendricks did office work for 25 hours per week earning $9 per hour, rather than the $12.23 she had been earning.  Hendricks filed suit seeking recovery of the $3.23 per hour pay differential between her wages as a utility driver and her wages while on light duty.  She asserted that while on light duty she was entitled to receive the pay rate she had received as a utility driver under both the FMLA and the collective bargaining agreement (CBA).  The district court granted Compass Group's motion for summary judgment and Hendricks appealed.</p>

<p align="justify">The FMLA regulations acknowledge that under some workers' compensation programs a health care provider may certify that an employee is able to return to light duty work and an employee is free to accept that light duty work or continue on unpaid FMLA leave.  </p>

<p align="justify">The court ruled that her reading of the statutes and regulations was incorrect and that there is no such thing as "FMLA light duty".  </p>

<p align="justify">Hendricks also contended that she was entitled to recover wages under the CBA.  Though the CBA states "Employees who work on a temporary basis in a lower paid classification shall retain their regular rate," this claim also failed because light duty was not among the classifications listed in the CBA.</p>

<strong>CA'S FEHA PUTS BURDEN OF PROOF ON EMPLOYEE TO SHOW QUALIFICATION</strong>

<p align="justify">California's Supreme Court has ruled that plaintiffs who claim disability discrimination under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) must prove they are qualified to perform the job's essential function, with or without reasonable accommodation.  Dwight D. Green vs. State of California.</p>


<p align="justify">When Mr. Green returned to work following a work-related injury in 2000, his employer's work coordinator discovered a 1997 doctor's report, which followed treatment for hepatitis, recommending light duty only for Mr. Green.</p>


<p align="justify">The same day, Mr. Green came to the work coordinator's office complaining of fatigue because of the hepatitis.  The work coordinator sent Mr. Green a letter telling him he could not return to his position unless he could be cleared for full duty.  After Mr. Green's request to return to work was denied he filed a disability discrimination claim with the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing and a complaint for damages in state superior court.</p>

<p align="justify">The trial judge did not instruct the jury that Mr. Green must prove he was qualified for the position and the jury awarded him $597,000 in economic damages and $2 million in noneconomic damages.  A state appellate court ruled that under FEHA the burden is on the defendant to establish that a plaintiff is incapable of performing the essential duties of a job.  The California Supreme Court disagreed and stated in its opinion "the Legislature has placed the burden on a plaintiff to show that he or she is a qualified individual under the FEHA."  This ruling makes the burden of proof under California's FEHA the same as under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>

<strong>MENTAL HEALTH PARITY PASSES SENATE</strong>

<p align="justify">On September 18 the US Senate passed the Mental Health Parity Act in a unanimous vote.  While the law does not require employers to provide mental health coverage, it does require those who do to have similar out of pocket expenses and treatment limits for mental health as for other health benefits.  Unlike the House bill, which passed in July, the Senate bill does not give more power to states to further strengthen standards, nor does it require employers to provide coverage for the same mental disorders and illnesses as the federal government covers for members of Congress.  However, if it gains the approval of the full Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce committees, many expect the Senate bill to be offered to the House for a vote to replace the House bill of July.  </p>

<strong>3RD US CIRCUIT COURT TOUGHENS BENEFIT REVIEW STANDARDS</strong>

<p align="justify">On September 17 the 3rd US Circuit Court issued a ruling that sets forth new standards for how judges should decide in cases that regard ERISA fiduciary claims.  The ruling stated that the previous judge had used too light a standard of review in the disability benefits case, since the insurer not only decided how to administer the benefits, but stood to pay them as well.  Post vs. Hartford Insurance Company</p>

<p align="justify">The case could affect other lawsuits in that it strengthens a 2000 decision in Pinto vs. Reliance Standard Life Insurance Co. which adopted a "sliding scale" standard of review for cases in which ERISA fiduciary duty seems to suffer conflict of interest.  The decision in that case stated that courts should consider both "structural" and "procedural" factors when deciding whether or not to scrutinize the case for conflict of interest more closely.  In the Post case Circuit Judge Thomas ruled that the previous judge had not sufficiently heightened the level of review, considering that the insurer was also the plan administrator.  </p>
<strong>SCHWARZENEGGER PROMISES HEALTH CARE VETO</strong>

<p align="justify">On September 12 Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vowed to veto A.B. 8, saying that it requires too much of employers, making it "financially unsustainable."  The Governor said he would call a special legislative session to work on the issue.  Please see our October Bulletin for coverage of October's events regarding the bill.  </p>
