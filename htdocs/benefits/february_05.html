<b>CMS Issues Final Regulations on Medicare Drug Benefits</b>

<p align="justify">On January 21, 2005, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued final regulations implementing the new Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). The MMA specifies that the prescription drug benefit program, known as Part D, will become available to beneficiaries beginning on January 1, 2006.

<p align="justify">Part D plans will have a $250 prescription drug deductible, with 75% coverage up to $2,250 in total charges. Part D will not pay anything after that until an individual’s out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs reach $3,600, at which point Medicare will pay 95% of covered charges.

<p align="justify">Generally, employers who offer drug benefits to their retirees (and their dependents) who are eligible for Medicare Part D can choose to:

<ul type="square">
<li>Continue to provide prescription drug coverage. If the coverage is actuarially equivalent to Part D, the plan sponsor is eligible for a Federal subsidy for each individual enrolled in the sponsor’s plan who is eligible for Part D but elects not to enroll in Part D.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Contract with a prescription drug plan or Medicare Advantage-prescription drug plan to offer prescription drug benefits to retirees who are eligible for Medicare. Alternatively, the retiree plan sponsor itself could apply to be a Part D plan for its retirees.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Provide separate prescription drug coverage that supplements (“wraps around”) the coverage offered under Part D.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">The subsidy will be equal to 28% of specified retiree drug costs. The MMA specifies that the subsidy may be made only for those costs that fall between the cost threshold and the cost limit. For 2006, the cost threshold is $250 and the cost limit is $5,000. In other words, the first $250 in prescription drug costs for an individual during a year and any prescription drug costs for that year that exceed $5,000 are disregarded for purposes of calculating the subsidy. The dollar values for the cost threshold and cost limit will be adjusted annually.

<p align="justify">In order to qualify for the retiree drug subsidy, a sponsor’s plan must meet a gross value test and an additional test that takes into account retiree premium payments. In order for plan sponsors to receive a subsidy payment for January 2006, plan sponsors (regardless of their plan year) must apply for the subsidy no later than September 30, 2005, unless an extension request is filed with CMS prior to that date. An attestation of actuarial equivalence is due at the same time.

<p align="justify">Similar applications and attestations will be required in each subsequent plan year. If a plan makes a mid-year plan change that materially affects the actuarial valuation, it must file a notice with CMS 90 days prior to the plan change.

<p align="justify">A sponsor may elect to receive subsidy payments monthly, quarterly or annually. Sponsors choosing the monthly, quarterly or an interim annual method of payment will be required to provide an annual reconciliation.  Insured plans can use premiums as the cost basis for interim subsidy payments.

<p align="justify">Sponsors are able to enroll in voluntary data sharing agreements (VDSAs) with CMS that will allow sponsors to submit a list of retirees and covered dependents prior to submitting an application for the retiree drug subsidy and have CMS determine which retirees and dependents are qualified covered retirees.

<p align="justify">CMS plans to develop methodologies for determining the actuarial valuation of prescription drug coverage. Plans may use qualified independent actuaries in certifying the actuarial value.

<p align="justify">Under these rules, sponsors that provide retirees (and their dependents) with supplemental coverage in effect delay the point at which an individual’s total drug spending will trigger catastrophic coverage, since participants will have lower out-of-pocket costs. Benefits paid under a group health plan will not count toward the out-of-pocket limit. Only costs paid by a Part D enrollee will count toward the annual out-of-pocket threshold as “true out-of-pocket” (TrOOP) expenditures. CMS has indicated that it will issue additional guidance on how to address timely calculations of TrOOP.

<p align="justify">For purposes of calculating TrOOP, payments made from Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) and Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) are treated as beneficiary money. Payments made from Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs) are treated as group health plan payments and do not count toward the TrOOP.

<p align="justify">A Part D enrollee who would otherwise be subject to a late enrollment penalty may avoid the penalty if his or her previous coverage met the standard of “creditable prescription drug coverage”. Group health plans must disclose whether the prescription drug coverage they provide to members who are eligible for Part D is creditable prescription drug coverage. CMS has indicated that it will provide additional guidance on the notices that must be provided by group health plans.

<p align="justify">If a sponsor elects to apply for the retiree drug subsidy, it is able to design its eligibility rules so that qualifying covered retirees and their dependents lose eligibility in the sponsor’s plan if they enroll in a Part D plan. The sponsor must give advance notice of this type of material change to plan participants as required by ERISA and any applicable state laws.
