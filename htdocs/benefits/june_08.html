<p><strong>PRESIDENT SIGNS HEART ACT</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On June 17, 2008, the President signed H.R. 6081, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief
Tax Act of 2008. Among other things, this bill retroactively reinstates the Mental Health Parity
Act of 1996, which had expired on December 31, 2007. Both houses of Congress have passed
bills that would expand the requirements of the Mental Health Parity Act, but a conference
committee has yet to resolve differences between the two versions. Published reports indicate
that conferees have agreed to drop a provision in the House version that would have required any
plan that covers mental health benefits to cover any diagnosis in the American Psychiatric
Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which includes such things as caffeine
addiction and jet lag.</p> 

<p align="justify">As reported in last month’s bulletin, H.R. 6081 also allows employers to amend their flexible
spending accounts to permit reservists called up for at least 6 months of active duty to take FSA
balances as a taxable distribution in cash. The new law does not address how this distribution
right impacts the employer's coverage continuation obligations under both USERRA and
COBRA. In addition, the bill does not amend Code Section 105, which disqualifies plans that
allow reimbursements for other than medical care expenses. </p>


<p><strong>CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY APPROVES BILL TO REQUIRE SICK LEAVE</strong></p>



<p align="justify">On May 28, 2008, the California Assembly approved A.B. 2716, which would require employers
to provide paid sick days.</p>  



<p align="justify">Under the bill, employees would be entitled to use accrued sick days beginning on the 90th
calendar day of employment. Employees would accrue sick days at the rate of one hour for
every 30 hours worked.</p> 


<p align="justify">The bill would require employers to provide paid sick days, upon the request of the employee,
for diagnosis, care or treatment of health conditions of the employee or an employee’s family
member or for leave related to domestic violence or sexual assault. An employer would be
prohibited from discriminating or retaliating against an employee who requests paid sick days.</p>

<p align="justify">The bill would also require employers to satisfy specified posting, notice and recordkeeping
requirements.</p>

<p><strong>SUPREME COURT RULES ON DISCRETIONARY CLAUSES</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) permits a person denied
benefits under an employee benefit plan to challenge that denial in federal court. Often the
entity that administers the plan, such as an employer or an insurance company, both determines
whether an employee is eligible for benefits and pays benefits out of its own pocket. The United
States Supreme Court has decided that this dual role creates a conflict of interest; and that a reviewing court should consider that conflict as a factor in determining whether the plan
administrator has abused its discretion in denying benefits; and that the significance of the factor
will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case.</p>

<p align="justify">This case is important, because under its Firestone ruling of almost two decades ago, the
Supreme Court said that if an ERISA plan grants discretion to someone to interpret the terms of
the plan, a court will only overturn that decision if the decision was arbitrary and capricious. If
the ERISA documents do not grant discretion, then courts will look at the case without regard to
the plan’s decision. Now the court has created a middle ground in which a court can decide just
how much deference to give to the decision of a person (or entity) with discretion who also has a
conflict of interest.</p>

<p align="justify">Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife) serves as both an administrator and the insurer
of Sears, Roebuck & Company’s long-term disability insurance plan, an ERISA-governed
employee benefit plan. The plan grants MetLife (as administrator) discretionary authority to
determine whether an employee’s claim for benefits is valid; it simultaneously provides that
MetLife (as insurer) will itself pay valid benefit claims.</p>

<p align="justify">Wanda Glenn, a Sears employee, applied for disability benefits and MetLife concluded that she
met the plan’s standard for an initial 24 months of benefits. MetLife also directed Glenn to a law
firm that would assist her in applying for Social Security disability benefits. An Administrative
Law Judge found that Glenn’s illness prevented her not only from performing her own job but
also “from performing any jobs [for which she could qualify] existing in significant numbers in
the national economy.” The Social Security Administration consequently granted Glenn
permanent disability payments retroactively.</p>

<p align="justify">To continue receiving Sears plan disability benefits after 24 months, Glenn had to meet a stricter,
Social-Security-type standard, namely, that her medical condition rendered her incapable of
performing not only her own job but of performing “the material duties of any gainful
occupation for which” she was “reasonably qualified.” MetLife denied Glenn this extended
benefit because it found that she was “capable of performing full time sedentary work.”</p>

<p align="justify">After exhausting her administrative remedies, Glenn brought this federal lawsuit, seeking
judicial review of MetLife’s denial of benefits. The District Court denied relief. Glenn appealed
to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The Court of Appeals treated “as a relevant factor”
a “conflict of interest” arising out of the fact that MetLife was “authorized both to decide
whether an employee is eligible for benefits and to pay those benefits.”</p>

<p align="justify">The Court of Appeals set aside MetLife’s denial of benefits and MetLife asked the Supreme
Court to determine whether a plan administrator that both evaluates and pays claims operates
under a conflict of interest in making discretionary benefit determinations. The Supreme Court
concluded that it does.</p>
