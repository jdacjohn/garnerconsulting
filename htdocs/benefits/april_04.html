<p><b>Seventh Circuit: FMLA Does Not Bar Termination</b>

<p align="justify">The Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in <i>Aubuchon v. Knauf Fiberglass</i> (No. 03-1382) ruled that the termination of an employee who missed several weeks of work to be with his pregnant wife did not violate the employee’s rights under FMLA. Mr. Aubuchon notified Knauf that he wanted to take FMLA leave in order to stay home with his wife, whose date of delivery was expected soon. Mr. Aubuchon did not cite the fact that his wife had experienced false labor or any complications that would constitute a serious health condition. Knauf denied the request for leave, by which time Mr. Aubuchon had not been at work for weeks and was terminated for unexcused absence. Mr. Aubuchon filed suit alleging his termination violated the FMLA. The Seventh Circuit stated: “Being pregnant, as distinct from being incapacitated because of pregnancy or experiencing complications of pregnancy that could include premature contractions which unless treated by drugs or bed rest might result in the premature birth of the baby, is not a serious health condition within the meaning of the statute or the applicable regulations.” The court went on to conclude: “the employee’s duty is merely to place the employer on notice of a probable basis for FMLA leave. He doesn’t have to write a brief demonstrating the legal entitlement. He just has to give the employer enough information to establish probable cause, as it were, to believe he is entitled to FMLA leave. That is enough to trigger the employer’s duty to request such additional information from the employee’s doctor or some other reputable source as may be necessary to confirm the employee’s entitlement.”

<p><b>IRS and DOL Issue HSA Guidance</b>

<p align="justify">The Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor have both issued guidance on the new Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). On April 12, 2004, the IRS published Internal Revenue Bulletin 2004-15, which included Revenue Ruling 2004-38, Notices 2004-23 and 2004-25 and Revenue Procedure 2004-22, all of which relate to HSAs.

<p align="justify">In order to be eligible for HSAs, people must be covered by a high deductible health plan (HDHP) and not have any other coverage. Revenue Ruling 2004-38 addresses the question of whether an HDHP can have prescription drug benefits that are not subject to the deductible, such as a copayment structure. In this ruling, the IRS holds that an individual who has a plan that provides prescription drug benefits before the minimum annual HDHP deductible has been satisfied is not eligible for an HSA. Revenue Procedure 2004-22 provides transition relief from this rule through the end of 2005. 

<p align="justify">HSAs can provide benefits not subject to the deductible, or subject to a lower deductible, for preventive care. Notice 2004-23 defines preventive care to include:

<ul type="square">

<li>Periodic health evaluations, including tests and diagnostic procedures ordered in connection with routine examinations, such as annual physicals.</li>

<li>Routine prenatal and well-child care.</li>

<li>Child and adult immunizations.</li>

<li>Tobacco cessation programs.</li>

<li>Obesity weight-loss programs.</li>

<li>Screening services.</li>
</ul>


<p align="justify">Specific screening services that fall under a safe harbor are listed in a two-page appendix. The IRS also requested comments on the extent to which benefits provided by an employee assistance program (EAP), mental health program or wellness program may qualify as preventive care, including comments regarding the scope of treatments provided as benefits through counseling and health assessments. In particular, they requested comments on the extent to which drug treatments, either solely by prescription or as part of an overall treatment regimen should be treated as preventive care and the appropriate standards for differentiating between drug treatments that would be considered preventive care and those that would not be considered preventive care. Until the IRS provides additional guidance on this subject, it is possible that most EAPs would disqualify employees from having HSAs.

<p align="justify">In general, qualified medical expenses must be incurred only after HSAs have been established. Notice 2004-25 provides transition relief from this requirement. Because of the short period between the enactment of HSAs and the effective date (less than a month), many taxpayers who otherwise would be eligible to establish HSAs have been unable to locate trustees or custodians who are willing and able to open HSAs. For calendar year 2004, HSAs established on or before April 15, 2005 may reimburse qualified medical expenses incurred on or after January 1, 2004 or the first day of the first month that the individual became eligible for an HSA, if later.

<p align="justify">On April 7, 2004, the Employee Benefits Security Administration of the Department of Labor (DOL) published Field Assistance Bulletin 2004-1, which addresses the issue of whether HSAs are welfare plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The DOL concludes that HSAs generally will not constitute plans for ERISA purposes where employer involvement is limited. Generally, the HDHPs required for HSA eligibility will be subject to ERISA.
