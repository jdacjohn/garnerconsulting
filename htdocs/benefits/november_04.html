<p><b>California Voters Repeal Pay-Or-Play Law</b>

<p align="justify">In the November elections, California’s voters repealed, by the narrow margin of 50.9% to 49.1%, last year’s new law (SB 2), which would have required large employers (200 or more employees) to pay 80% of both employee and dependent premiums beginning January 1, 2006 or pay a fee to a fund that would provide health insurance to those employees and dependents. Employers with 50 through 199 employees would have been required to pay 80% of employee premiums beginning January 1, 2007 or pay a fee. Employers with 20 through 49 employees would not have been required to do anything until the legislature approved a subsidy. Employers with less than 20 employees were exempt.
