<b>AARP Appeals In Long Battle Over Tiered Retiree Health Benefits</b>

<p align="justify">On October 12, 2005, the AARP filed an appeal with the 3<sup>rd</sup> U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, stating that it disagrees with the latest decision in a long-running battle over retiree medical benefits that began with the Erie County case. 
 
<p align="justify">On August 1, 2000, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3<sup>rd</sup> Circuit ruled that a common retiree medical plan design violates the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). In an attempt to control health care costs, Erie County changed to a tiered system with richer benefits for early retirees and lesser benefits for those with Medicare. When older retirees sued, the county said the distinction in benefits was based on eligibility for Medicare. The court of appeals said that Medicare is a proxy for age and therefore the plan design is discriminatory.

<p align="justify">Most employers have assumed that the ADEA only applies to employees, not retirees. Many employers terminate retiree medical benefits when retirees reach age 65 or drastically reduce the benefits. Both approaches would appear to be prohibited under this case's reasoning.

<p align="justify">On October 3, 2000, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued a new section of its compliance manual, in which the guidance reflected this decision, the only court case that has considered the issue of whether the ADEA applies to retirees.
 
<p align="justify">On July 14, 2003, the EEOC published proposed regulations that would allow the practice of reducing or eliminating retiree health benefits when retirees become eligible for Medicare.

<p align="justify">On March 30, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District banned the EEOC from publishing and putting into effect its proposed rule to exempt retiree health care plans from the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The case was brought to the court by the AARP, which argues that providing different health care benefits for Medicare-eligible and younger retirees amounts to age discrimination.

<p align="justify">The EEOC filed an appeal approximately two months later. Then, in June 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a relatively unrelated case, National Cable and Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Services, U.S., 125 S. Ct. 2688 (2005), that government agencies are only barred from interpreting a statute differently from a court if the court's interpretation is the only permissible one.  

<p align="justify">Judge Anita Brody then gave the EEOC permission to request that she vacate her previous order, and she proceeded to do so. On September 27, 2005, she issued a decision in which she effectively nullified her previous decision. However, since she knew both parties would appeal, she left the injunction against the publication of the EEOC's new ruling in effect.  

<p><b>Employer Held Liable For Failure To Notify Carrier Of COBRA Election</b>

<p align="justify">A federal district court in Michigan ruled that an employer can be held liable for medical expenses incurred by an ex-employee who had elected COBRA coverage, but whose carrier was not informed, nor were premiums paid. The participant sought all unreimbursed expenses, but the court ruled that only the charges that the hospital would have submitted to the insurer, nearly $63,000 were payable, and not over $95,000, as was charged. The participant was charged by the hospital as an uninsured person.  

<p><b>President Signs National Patient Safety Database Law</b>

<p align="justify">In late July, President Bush signed into law a bill that would establish a national patient safety database for the voluntary reporting of medical errors. Health care providers would be encouraged to self-report errors. The Department of Health and Human Services is expected to analyze the data and develop recommendations to reduce these errors.  

<p align="justify">The data would not include patient, provider or even the individual reporter's identification, and a $10,000 fine is in place to discourage disclosure of such information. The information would also be protected from use in lawsuits, such as medical malpractice suits, as well as use by an accrediting organization to punish a provider. The one exception would be in the case that a judge rules such information to be evidence of a criminal act.  

<p><b>Florida Introduces State Sponsored HSA/HDHP Plan</b>

<p align="justify">Governor Jeb Bush has launched what has been dubbed the Health Investor Health Plan, a plan for state employees of Florida which consists of a high deductible health plan (HDHP) and a Health Savings Account (HSA). The plan, which was rolled out for 2006, is available to over 360,000 public employees, retirees and dependents. The state is funding the Health Savings Accounts at $500 per single beneficiary and $1,000 per family per year.  

<p><b>Medicare Changes Announced</b>

<p align="justify">The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has announced the annual Medicare changes for 2006, which include the following: 

<ul type="square">
<li>The inpatient hospital deductible will be $952 for the first 60 days, up from $912 in 2005;</li> 
<li>The daily coinsurance amount for the 61<sup>st</sup> through 90<sup>th</sup> days of hospitalization in a benefit period will be $238 (1/4 of the inpatient hospital deductible), up from $228 in 2005;</li>
<li>The daily coinsurance amount for lifetime reserve days will be $476 (1/2 of the inpatient The Part A monthly premium will be $393, up from $375 in 2005 for a person who has fewer than 30 quarters of Medicare-covered employment and $216, up from $206 in 2005, for a person who has 30 to 39 quarters of Medicare-covered employment;</li>
<li>The Part B monthly premium will be $88.50, up from $78.20 in 2005.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>DOL Offers Relief To Businesses Affected By Katrina</b>

<p align="justify">The U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) announced IN LATE September that it would extend the deadline for filing Form 5500 annual report/returns due to property damage and destruction from Hurricane Katrina in Florida.

<p align="justify">Under this relief, Form 5500 series filings required to be filed between August 24, 2005, and January 3, 2006, are granted an extension until January 3, 2006. Plan filers entitled to an extension of relief should check Part I, Box D, on the Form 5500 or Part 1 on Form 5500-EZ and attach a statement to the form in accordance with the instructions.
