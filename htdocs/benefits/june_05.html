<b>IRS Budges On "Use It Or Lose It" But New Grace Period For FSAs Causes Some Headaches</b>

<p align="justify">Our May Bulletin promised more details on TreasuryNotice 2005-42, which allows plan sponsors to allow for a period of up to 2 ½ months past the end of the plan year in which to incur FSA-qualified expenses.

<p align="justify">First, here are the basics for employers to consider as they evaluate whether or not to implement a grace period:

<ol>
<li><b>The employer must amend the plan documents to incorporate the rule</b>. Employers or plan sponsors are not required to implement the rule. However, if an employer decides to implement the rule, the employer must amend the plan document prior to the intended effective date of the rule (i.e. prior to the end of the plan year to which you want the rule to apply). Employers may implement the rule for the current plan year so long as they amend the plan document prior to the end the current plan year. As with other plan amendments, employers/plan sponsors should amend the plan in accordance with the terms of the plan document and the plan sponsor's rules for taking legal action.</li>

<li><b>The grace period must apply to all cafeteria plan participants</b>. If taken literally, this rule could mean that employers need to offer a grace period on all cafeteria plan benefits, but this is not necessary. Logically, the rule should be satisfied as long as the grace period is equally available to all participants, even if they do not elect an FSA. The Section 125 nondiscrimination rules and the applicable benefit plan nondiscrimination rules should adequately prevent any potential abuses.</li> 

<li><b>The grace period may not extend beyond the 15<sup>th</sup> day of the third month following the end of the plan year; however, it may be shorter</b>. Employers or plan sponsors may establish a shorter grace period. Some employers may have valid business reasons for limiting the duration of the grace period.</li>

<li><b>Temporary carry over amounts may not be used for any other taxable or non-taxable benefits</b>. Not surprisingly, unused funds from the health FSA may only be used to reimburse eligible health FSA expenses incurred during the grace period and likewise for unused dependent care amounts.</li>

<li><b>Determine the run out period, if any, following the grace period</b>. Although not required, an employer or plan sponsor may use a run out period following the grace period during which participants can submit expenses incurred during the grace period but submitted afterward during the run out period.</li>
</ol>

<p align="justify">Reaction to the grace period has been mixed. Employers generally welcome the idea of providing their employees with additional flexibility and some Congressional representatives also see the change as a move in the right direction, lowering the "use-it-or-lose-it" barrier, although most believe more needs to be done. 

<p align="justify">At the same time, however, many point to some obviously unforeseen ramifications of the Notice, including the fact that the time extension could make employees ineligible for Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). For example, if an employer offers the grace period, it must be available to all FSA participants. This means that if a health FSA participant decided to switch to an HSA, the FSA and HSA plan years would overlap by two and a half months. Under the HSA rules, an employee may not participate in both an HSA and a standard health FSA; so this would make the participant ineligible for the HSA. This can be remedied through the plan document if the employer makes changes limiting the use of the FSA expenses incurred after December 31 to only those that are not covered by a high-deductible health plan. The IRS has informally indicated that they are considering ways to address this problem. 

<p align="justify">Administrators are also questioning the cost-benefit trade-off of providing employers the ability to offer such a limited amount of extra time. It is debatable whether there will be increased participation and whether it will be enough to offset costs. 

<p align="justify">Debit cards also pose problems. Since the notice allows expenses incurred during the grace period to be reimbursed from the FSA balance of either a prior plan year or the current plan year, it could prove challenging to re-program debit cards to distinguish between previous and current-year medical expenses. 

<p align="justify">In addition, it is possible that adding a grace period to a Section 125 Plan may have unintended consequences under the HIPAA portability regulations (such as loss of status as an excepted benefit). It is also unclear whether the addition of a grace period would require COBRA coverage to be extended through the end of the following plan year. 

<p align="justify">The IRS notice has refueled interest in achieving true FSA use-it-or-lose-it reform. It seems at this point as if the IRS has decided to leave that up to the U.S. Congress. 

<p align="justify">The most popular legislation currently being considered would allow an FSA rollover, which would allow a limited amount of unused funds from a prior plan year to be transferred to the next plan year. The Secretary of the Treasury determined that he does not have the authority to allow a rollover by regulation, so the only chance of reform is through legislative change.
