<p><strong>PRESIDENT SIGNS GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On May 21, 2008, President Bush signed H.R. 493, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination
Act (GINA) of 2008. This new law prohibits discrimination on the basis of genetic information
with respect to health insurance and employment.</p> 

<p align="justify">GINA prohibits health plans, insurers and employers from requesting, requiring or purchasing
the results of genetic tests and also forbids them from disclosing genetic information. The new
law also prohibits employers from firing, refusing to hire or otherwise discriminating against
employees with respect to compensation and other terms of employment.</p>

<p align="justify">GINA is not expected to have a very big impact. The Congressional Budget Office estimated
that it would increase the number of individuals who obtain health insurance by about 600
people per year, nearly all of whom would obtain insurance in the individual market.</p>

<p align="justify">The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 already prohibits group health
plans from using genetic information to deny coverage or adjust premium rates of an individual
within a group. GINA prohibits group health plans and group insurers from adjusting premiums
or contributions for a group based on genetic information of an individual enrolled in a plan.</p>

<p align="justify">Employers are allowed to offer health and genetic services to an individual as part of a wellness
program if:</p>

<li>The individual provides prior, knowing, voluntary and written authorization</li>
<li>Only the individual (or family member if they receive the services) and a health care
professional involved in providing services receives individually identifiable information,
and</li>
<li>The employer receives only aggregated, de-identified information.</li>

<p align="justify">The GINA provisions that apply to group health plans will be effective for plan years beginning
on and after May 21, 2009. The GINA provisions that apply to employers (including provisions
related to wellness plans) will be effective on November 21, 2009.</p>
<p align="justify">GINA does not pre-empt state laws that provide greater protection.</p>

<p><strong>HEARINGS HELD ON NATIONAL HEALTH REFORM</strong></p>

<p align="justify">be held this year on reforming the health care system. The committee also plans to host a
“summit” on health care on June 16, 2008 and has invited the entire Congress.</p>

<p align="justify">The only witnesses at the initial hearing were former Secretaries of the Department of Health
and Human Services Tommy Thompson and Donna Shalala. Both agreed on the need to address
broad, systemic reforms in cost and access.</p>

<p align="justify">Shalala spent a lot of time discussing lessons learned from President Clinton’s unsuccessful
health care reform attempt in 1993 and 1994. She noted that it is important to have widespread
agreement on the solution and that the elements be kept simple.</p>  

<p align="justify">In his opening statement, Chairman Max Baucus (D-MT) said “This committee must prepare for
the challenge of building consensus.” He also said “I am confident that, this time we will
succeed.”</p>  
<p align="justify">Ranking Republican Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) said it is important not to upend the
system and observed that “people are used to their employers providing their health benefits.”
He went on to say “I think we need to look into whether we can expand health care coverage by
making the current unlimited income tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance more
equitable while increasing the tax benefits for taxpayers purchasing non-group coverage.”</p>  

<p><strong>CONGRESS PASSES BILL TO ALLOW FSA DISTRIBUTIONS FOR RESERVISTS</strong></p>



<p align="justify">On May 22, 2008, the US Senate passed H.R. 6081, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief
Tax Act of 2008. The House passed it on May 20, 2008. Having passed in identical form in
both the House and Senate, this bill now awaits the signature of the President before becoming
law.</p>  



<p align="justify">Among other things, this bill allows employers to amend their flexible spending accounts to
permit reservists called up for at least 6 months of active duty to take FSA balances as a taxable
distribution in cash.</p> 

<p><strong>CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT OKs SAME-SEX MARRIAGES</strong></p>



<p align="justify">On May 15, 2008, the California Supreme Court ruled that it is unconstitutional to deprive gays
and lesbians of the equal right to marriage. The ruling should have minimal impact on insured
plans in California since they are already required to cover domestic partners registered with the
state.</p>  



<p align="justify">Opponents of same-sex marriage have already qualified an initiative for the November ballot that
would amend the state constitution to say that marriage is only between a man and a woman.</p>
