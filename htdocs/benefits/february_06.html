<b>Ever More States Contemplate 'Wal-Mart' Bills</b>

<p align="justify">During his State of the State address on January 17, Wisconsin governor Jim Doyle spoke strongly in support of his proposed bill that would curb companies' ability to do what he calls health care "dumping." Referring to a practice by which employers drop coverage or make it prohibitively expensive for employees, thereby forcing them to use state health programs. The so-called Badger Care is meant to help working families, Doyle stated, not multi-billion dollar corporations. Doyle singled out Wal-Mart in his speech, joining with executives and legislators in several states in the controversy over alleged employee benefits policies of the retail giant.</p>

<p align="justify">Nonetheless, the Wisconsin Assembly heard testimony the following week, and a bill that would have required companies with more than 10,000 employees to contribute 80% or more of health care costs died in that hearing. Doyle stated that he would re-introduce similar legislation soon, and a spokesman for Wal-Mart said that the passage of such legislation would send "a clear message to employers . . . [that] Wisconsin is closed for business."</p>

<p align="justify">At the same time, the West Virginia state legislature began to consider a bill very close to the Fair Share Bill recently passed in Maryland, which requires employers with over 10,000 workers to spend at least 8% of payroll costs for health care. The alternative in West Virginia would be to pay the difference into the state's Medicaid fund.</P>

<p align="justify">Kentucky introduced a similar bill late in January, but it is currently opposed by the governor. In addition, the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services issued a statement that it fears companies may slash jobs to cut payroll costs in order to avoid action required by the bill.</p> 

<p align="justify">Meanwhile, attorneys for Wal-Mart, the US Chamber of Commerce and the Maryland Chamber of Commerce are also looking into the possibilities of filing a lawsuit under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and a suit was filed just last week on behalf of a trade group that includes Wal-Mart.</p>

<p><b>Crooked Broker Determined Fiduciary Under ERISA</b></p>

<p align="justify">The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in late January, decided in favor of the Department of Labor's allegation of a fiduciary breach under ERISA. The broker, Brittian Day, is alleged to have collected premiums from clients and deposited them into his corporate account, then issuing fake policies rather than purchasing insurance. A federal judge had ordered Day to pay the DoL almost $1 million in damages, and he appealed on the grounds that he was not a fiduciary.</p> 

<p align="justify">In affirming the previous decision, the appeals court noted that ERISA defines fiduciaries as any person who "exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management or disposition of its assets." The court stated, however, that its decision was not meant to extend the status of fiduciary to any person who has custody over plan assets. Day was more than a mere custodian, it stated, as he solicited, accepted, and then stole plan assets.</p>

<p><b>Gender Reassignment Not Deductible Expense, Says IRS</b></p>

<p align="justify">The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a memo at the end of January stating that costs for gender reassignment surgery and related costs are not considered deductible medical expenses. Referring to a man who was diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder from which he had suffered since childhood, the IRS said that IRC Section 213 does not include cosmetic surgery unless it is necessary to correct a congenital abnormality, disfiguring disease or injury resulting from trauma. The IRS concluded that it would not allow the deduction unless Congress expresses intent that this type of treatment should be considered a deductible medical expense.</p>

<p><b>Health Care Costs Rising Faster Than Incomes</b></p>

<p align="justify">The Commonwealth Fund released a new report this month regarding the rise in health care costs as compared to incomes in the period from 1996 to 2002. Factoring in premium payments, the study found that 23% of American families spent high percentages of household income on health care. "High," in this study, means 5% for low-income families and 10% for others. Interestingly, the study found that the prevalence of high out-of-pocket costs is rising most for fully-insured, non-elderly families, in which all members have coverage throughout the whole year.</p>

<p><b>Plan Forbidden To Limit Enrollment For Workers On Leave</b></p>

<p align="justify">The US Court of Appeals for the District of South Dakota ruled in late January that a health care plan administrator cannot limit the special enrollment period allowed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) by requiring that workers on leave return to full time service before enrolling. The court pointed to HIPAA's prohibition of eligibility discrimination based on health status.</p>

<p align="justify">In this case, a worker who was on medical leave following childbirth was denied coverage for herself and her son, though she applied within 30 days of the birth. The administrator stated that the employee had been a part-time employee at the time of the birth, but neither the administrator nor the employer had filed paperwork changing her status from full time to part time. Also, neither had sent the employee a notice that she had become eligible for continuation coverage through COBRA, which should have happened when she reduced her hours.</p>
