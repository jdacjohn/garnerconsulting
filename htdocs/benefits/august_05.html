<b>Account-Based Plans No Good For Medicare Drug Determination</b>

<p align="justify">The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) reiterated on July 21, 2005 that most account-based plans will not be eligible for the Part D retiree drug subsidy.

<p align="justify">Specifically, flexible spending arrangements (FSAs), health savings accounts (HSAs), and archer medical savings accounts (MSAs) cannot be counted toward creditable coverage for beneficiaries. Employer and union-sponsored plans must show they provided creditable coverage for prescription drugs that is actuarially equivalent to the Part D benefit in order to receive the subsidy.

<p align="justify">The guidance provides details about ascertaining creditable coverage status for health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs), the only type of account-based plan that could be eligible for the subsidy.

<p align="justify">However, CMS said that beneficiaries may withdraw funds from FSAs, HSAs, and MSAs to cover Part D cost-sharing amounts, and those funds would count toward an individual's $3,600 true out-of-pocket limit.

<p><b>Dual-Purpose Plans Fail Vesting Rules Qualification</b>

<p align="justify">The Internal Revenue Service ruled on July 27, 2005 that dual-purpose plans, profit-sharing/401(k) plans which would reserve a portion of the employer's contributions for a separate account to pay for medical expenses on a pre-tax basis, violate vesting rules under Code sections 407(a)(7) and 411.  

<p align="justify">The plan design cited in the ruling consists of an employer allocating 25% of profit sharing contributions to a medical reimbursement account. Since the account only reimburses qualified medical expenses for the employee and his or her dependents, it does satisfy the rules for tax-free reimbursements. However, the fact that any remaining balance in the account would revert to the employer in the event of the death of the employee with no surviving dependents violates vesting rules.  

<p align="justify">While the accounts would be especially well suited to defined-contribution retiree health plans as well as being triply tax-free (deductible contributions, tax-free interest earning, tax-free reimbursements), benefits experts will have to contemplate possibilities which are compliant with vesting rules as well as Code section 105(b) regarding health expenses.  

<p><b>Sexual Discrimination Case Involves Use Of FMLA</b> 

<p align="justify">On August 2, 2005 a three-judge panel of the 10<sup>th</sup> U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously reversed part of a lower court ruling involving FMLA leave and sexual discrimination. The case is <i>Orr vs. City of Albuquerque</i>.

<p align="justify">The court ruled that the City of Albuquerque, New Mexico may have engaged in sexual discrimination when it let male police officers use compensatory time off for FMLA leave, but required female officers to use sick days.

<p align="justify">In quoting another case, the court said "The female plaintiffs' evidence is sufficient to raise an inference of discrimination because they have 'presented admissible evidence that Defendant (the city) treated at least one non-pregnant employee . . .  more favorably than' [them]".

<p align="justify">The 10<sup>th</sup> Circuit remanded the case for further proceedings by the lower court.

<p><b>US District Court Rules On Prompt Reemployment Under USERRA</b> 

<p align="justify">On August 2, 2005 a US District Court judge ruled in favor of Sykes Enterprises, Inc., saying that the company met the requirements for prompt reemployment of two employees returning from Iraq.  

<p align="justify">Ron Vander Wal applied for reemployment in March 2004, without mentioning that he was a veteran, and when told there were no available positions he hired an attorney. Due to technical difficulties in receiving correspondence from the attorney, Sykes did not reemploy Vander Wal on April 27, 2004, as requested, but did offer him a job as of May 4, 2004; the day he had indicated he would be available.  

<p align="justify">Michael Vender-Dahl was told he had been laid off while he was in Iraq, but was offered a job within four days of applying for reemployment on April 23, 2004. He was also allowed to start work on May 4, 2004.  

<p align="justify">Chief District Judge Daniel Hoyland judged that the two, Vander Wal who was hired on the day he said he would be available, and Vender-Dahl who was hired seven days after he applied for reemployment, were rehired promptly under the law. Hoyland concedes in his opinion that USERRA is not clear on what constitutes prompt reemployment, but notes that it is clear in not requiring immediate reemployment. He cited the US 5<sup>th</sup> Circuit Court of Appeals, which has stated that prompt should correspond with the soonest <i>practicable</i> reemployment.  
 
<p><b>Treasury And IRS Issue Proposed Regulations On HSA Comparability</b>

<p align="justify">On August 25, 2005 the IRS and Treasury issued proposed regulations regarding comparability rules for employer health savings account contributions. The rules are in keeping with previously issued guidance and provide additional clarifications not previously provided.  

<p align="justify">Uniquely, HSA non-discrimination rules do not restrict the amount of benefits provided to highly compensated employees. Instead, the HSA law bases comparable contributions on the amount of the deductible of the HDHP, requiring either the same dollar amount or the same percentage of the deductible be contributed for all employees. These new regulations include a troubling clause that requires union employees to be treated the same as all other employees. Most nondiscrimination rules provide an exception for employees where benefits have been a subject of good-faith bargaining. This means that employers may have to wait until the expiration of collective bargaining agreements to add HSA contributions, unless the agreements can be reopened.

<p><b>California Insurance Commissioner Issues Report And Announces Hearings</b>

<p align="justify">John Garamendi announced the results of a study on California's insurance market on August 3, 2005 which he says shows a growing problem with rising administrative costs, "skeletal" policies being offered with limited benefits, and the price of health plans keeping many Californians from obtaining insurance. He also announced that he will hold hearings in San Francisco and Los Angeles later this year to explore how to repair the insurance market in which, he says "insurance companies keep too much of the premium dollar, fattening their executives' wallets . . . at the expense of patients and doctors."

<p align="justify">The Commissioner aims to reform the system with attention both to immediate concerns and the long-term goal of universal access to health care.
