<strong>President Proposes Tax Changes Affecting Health Insurance</strong>

<p align="justify">President Bush’s budget for fiscal year 2008 includes major changes to the way health insurance is or is not taxed. Currently the premiums employers pay on behalf of employee health insurance are not taxed to the employees. Under the President’s proposal, these premiums would be added to the employee’s taxable income. The President proposes creating a standard deduction for health insurance instead of allowing employers to pay for health insurance on a tax-free basis.</p>

<p align="justify">Taxpayers who obtain qualifying health insurance (the details have yet to be worked out as to what is “qualifying”) would be allowed a standard deduction of $7,500 for single coverage or $15,000 for family coverage. The deduction would come before calculating adjusted gross income. The same deduction amounts would apply even if the actual cost of the insurance was less. The same amounts would apply regardless of whether the insurance was purchased through an employer or as an individual. For people with coverage less than a full year, pro-rated amounts would apply.</p>

<p align="justify">The proposal would also tax flexible spending accounts (FSAs) and contributions made on a salary-reduction basis through cafeteria plans, rendering FSAs and pre-tax contributions meaningless. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) would continue to exist.</p>

<p align="justify">Employer contributions for health insurance would be included in income for both income tax purposes and for purposes of calculating Social Security and Medicare taxes.</p>

<p align="justify">The President’s proposal includes a provision for Association Health Plans, which would allow small businesses to purchase health insurance through trade associations without being subject to state insurance laws.</p>

<p align="justify">A number of observers have commented about perceived inequities with the proposed approach. Given differences in the cost of health insurance based on geography, industry and age, the standard deduction will be more valuable to some people than to others. A deduction is also worth more to high-income taxpayers than to low-income taxpayers. Of course, the current system is inequitable in that it favors employer-sponsored insurance over individually purchased insurance.</p>

<p align="justify">There are also uncertainties as to what is included in the scope of the proposal. For example, can employers still offer wellness plans on a tax-free basis?</p>

<p align="justify">Many people have expressed concern that if this proposal were adopted it would be the end of employer payments toward the cost of health insurance. For that reason, it has been described as “dead on arrival” by some, or at least “wounded on arrival”.</p>

<p><strong>CMS Issues HIPAA Security Guidance For Remote Use And Access</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued guidance regarding the remote use and access of patients' electronic protected health information (ePHI) in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) security rule. The guidance includes strategies that may be reasonable and appropriate for covered entities to adopt.</p>

<p align="justify">CMS recommends that covered entities take the following steps, in accordance with their risk assessments: (1) employ encryption of the appropriate strength on all portable or remote devices that store ePHI; (2) back up all ePHI entered into remote systems; and (3) install virus-protection software on portable devices.</p>

<p><strong>Schwarzenegger’s Plan For California Receives Mixed Reviews</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On January 8, 2007, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger outlined his plan for California’s health insurance market to the state legislature. In the proposal available on his website, the Governor has laid out an intricate and sometimes vague plan for increasing prevention, health and wellness, covering all Californians, and reducing costs. The plan’s reception has been mixed, with some groups worried about hidden taxes, others concerned about business costs rising in the state, and some concern about what a personal mandate and guaranteed coverage would do to the industry.</p>

<p align="justify">As we watch the debate rage on, however, it is helpful to look at the specifics of the proposal. Here is a digest of what the Governor has actually suggested:</p>

<p align="justify"><strong><em>Wellness and Prevention:</em></strong> The plan proposes an incentive/reward program to be implemented for both public and private sector health plans, rewarding people for healthy behaviors which are shown to reduce the incidence and cost of chronic disease. The governor suggests premium reductions for private plans, and gym memberships or weight loss programs for public plans, as well as requiring all plans and insurers to provide incentive programs. Medical errors are also addressed in the proposal: and suggested remedies include requiring electronic prescribing by 2010, implementation of evidence-based medicine, and academic pondering of ways to improve patient safety. Obesity and tobacco use battles are also mentioned in the proposal, pointing to enhancement of programs already in place.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong><em>Universal Coverage:</em></strong> The plan outlines several approaches to covering more Californians. As with car insurance, the Governor suggests requiring all individuals to have a minimum level of coverage. This will be achieved by expanding Medi-Cal and Healthy Families for low income citizens, providing premium subsidies for those who do not qualify for public insurance, but who can’t afford premiums on their own, and encouraging employers to sponsor coverage. Premium contributions for those with subsidies would be on a sliding scale, and employers with more than 10 employees would face a 4% fee to the state if they do not provide coverage.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong><em>Affordability:</em></strong> In the interest of reducing costs and increasing access to care, the governor’s plan includes several measures: increasing the Medi-Cal reimbursements to hospitals for care, redirecting funding for the medically indigent, mandating insurer and HMO efficiency, increasing the tax advantages of Health Savings Accounts and requiring employers to offer pre-tax premium contributions, legislating in favor of the use of more nurse practitioners and physician’s assistants, as well as integrating worker’s compensation with regular health care systems to streamline the provision of care. The plan also calls for a fee on gross revenues (4% for hospitals and 2% for physicians) to be contributed to the state’s universal coverage funds.</p>

<p align="justify">In addition, the plan calls for academic study of certain issues, and the use of the state’s university systems as a resource in developing health information technology to increase the efficiency and safety of care in California. Last, the proposal suggests that California do a better job of leveraging its buying power.</p>

<p align="justify">With many sweeping suggestions and little nitty-gritty, the Governor’s plan has stirred up bees’ nests in many parts of the state, from the insurance industry to concerned employers to politicians worried about the affects it could have on their constituents. Look for lots of debate in the near future along with controversy, and surely some backpedaling as many California groups weigh in on the need to address the health care crisis in California.</p>
