<b>Half Of Employers Plan To Implement FSA Grace Period</b>

<p align="justify">The ERISA Industry Committee released a report in August stating that half of the 318 employers surveyed plan to offer the two-and-a-half month grace period to employees for use with their health Flexible Spending Accounts. Only thirty four percent, however, plan to offer the grace period for dependent care FSAs.

<p align="justify">Employers who plan not to offer the grace period cited several factors influencing their decision, including:

<ul type="square">
<li>Dependent care expenses are more predictable than health care expenses</li>
<li>No prior problems with forfeitures due to "use it or lose it" rule</li>
<li>Concerns about employee communication</li>
<li>Concerns about inadvertent tax problems, such as additional federal income and payroll tax liability</li>
<li>Concerns about tracking two account balances simultaneously</li>
<li>Concerns about W-2 reporting problems.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">A majority of those offering the grace period will do so within the year. Many who are not offering the grace period may do so next year, and have said that they are waiting for more Treasury guidance, feedback from early-implementers, and employee requests for the grace period.

<p><b>Ex-Chase Manhattan Employee Wins Battle In War Over LTD Coverage</b>

<p align="justify">On August 3, 2005, Judge R. Barclay Surrick, of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, ruled that plaintiff Joseph Hussey can present evidence that a large number of Chase employees were eligible to participate in a long-term disability program but were not informed of their eligibility. Hussey's lawsuit, alleging that Chase breached its fiduciary duty to employees by not informing them of the specifics of eligibility, is strengthened by the court's decision not to exclude evidence that Chase's HR department suffered organizational problems at the time.  

<p align="justify">Allowing the evidence as key to the plaintiff's arguments, Judge Surrick effectively denied Chase's claim that the distribution of the plan's SPD fulfilled its fiduciary duty under ERISA. The court made clear that though Chase distributed the SPD within the requisite 90 days, this did not fulfil all fiduciary duty, and the case will be allowed to continue.  

<p><b>COBRA Plan Ruled Secondary To Longer-Term Dependent Plan</b> 

<p align="justify">When two plans are in effect and the Coordination of Benefit (COB) rules are unclear as to which plan should be considered primary, how can courts decide which plan should pay? In August, the US District Court for the Northern District of Ohio ruled that the plan which covered the insured longer should be considered primary.  

<p align="justify">In the case of Peggy Osting, her employer offered her COBRA coverage upon termination of employment, although she was covered as a dependent on her husband's health plan. After it had paid over one hundred thousand dollars in claims, the COBRA plan tried to recoup costs from the spouse's plan. The plans wound up suing each other to determine which was primary. Because Osting's husband's plan began covering her over a year before the COBRA coverage went into effect, the court ruled that it was the primary plan.

<p align="justify">This ruling is in conflict with a recent clarification to the COB rules by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The NAIC issues model rules to help establish a uniform order of benefit determination. The NAIC rules are only binding on insured plans and only after they have been adopted by the state in which the policy is issued. The 2005 clarification says that the order of benefit determination rules should be applied sequentially. The first rule is that the plan covering a person as a non-dependent is primary to a plan covering the person as a dependent. The fourth Rule says that a plan covering a person under state or federal continuation coverage, such as COBRA, is secondary to another plan. The fifth rule says that the plan covering the person for the longer period of time is primary.  

<p><b>Council For Affordable Health Care's HSA Scorecard Released</b> 

<p align="justify">The Council for Affordable Health Care (CAHI) announced on August 23, 2005 that Mississippi and Arkansas have passed legislation to allow HSA-contributions to be free of state as well as federal taxes. In the survey report CAHI reported that ten other states, including California, are considering such legislation. The issue is moot in states without state income taxes.  

<p align="justify">CAHI reports that many states have laws that conflict with HSA requirements, which hinders carriers' ability to offer compatible plans. The report states, however, that "the issues highlighted in this document are easily rectified with the appropriate legislation and would greatly enhance people's access to HSAs and affordable coverage."  

<p align="justify">Eleven states have adopted HSAs for their high-risk pool plans and two are considering it. Several states have introduced legislation to allow state employees to enroll in state-sponsored HSAs. Iowa has passed a law adding HSAs to its Medicaid plan and South Carolina is awaiting approval from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for a similar plan.  

<p><b>Fourth And Fifth Circuit Courts Conflict Over FMLA Waivers</b>

<p align="justify">A decision of the 4<sup>th</sup> Circuit Court of Appeals, on July 20, 2005, upheld a woman's right to sue her former employer for FMLA violations. In opposition to a 5<sup>th</sup> Circuit decision in 2003, the July decision cited a Department of Labor regulation that employees "cannot waive, nor may employers induce employees to waive, their rights" under FLMA.  

<p align="justify">In the case of a woman who was incorrectly informed that she could not take FMLA leave for absences under 5 days long, the court found that even though she signed a general release and severance agreement the plaintiff was allowed to sue. Though she signed a document stating that she waived her rights to make claims under federal, state or local law, the court said, "Without the regulation's non-waiver position, the unscrupulous employer could systematically violate the FMLA and gain a competitive advantage by buying out FMLA claims at a discount rate."

<p align="justify">National employers will now have to either draft documents that are compliant with the more conservative 4<sup>th</sup> Circuit decision or create different documents for different states. Until a possible decision in the Supreme Court, this decision will cause great consternation to employers around the country.
