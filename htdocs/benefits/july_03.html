<b>EEOC Issues Proposed Regulations On Retiree Health Plans</b>

<p align="justify">On July 14, 2003, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) published proposed regulations on the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and its interaction with retiree health benefits. The EEOC proposes to allow the common practice of reducing or eliminating retiree health benefits when retirees become eligible for Medicare. By issuing these proposed regulations, the EEOC intends to ensure that the application of the ADEA does not discourage employers from providing health benefits to retirees.

<p align="justify">The ADEA includes a provision that the EEOC may establish reasonable exemptions from provisions of the Act that the EEOC may find in the public interest. EEOC’s exercise of this authority has been limited. After an in-depth study, the EEOC concluded that the practice of reducing or eliminating health benefits when retirees become eligible for Medicare presents a circumstance that warrants exercise of the EEOC’s ADEA exemption authority.

<p align="justify">In August 2001, the EEOC announced that it would study the relationship between ADEA and retiree health benefits. Employers are not legally obligated to provide retiree health benefits and many do not. In 2001, only about one-third of large employers and less than 10% of small employers offered retiree health benefits. Employers who choose to provide retiree health benefits are not required to provide such benefits indefinitely, absent some contractual agreement to the contrary.

<p align="justify">The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to “compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such individual’s age.” The ADEA applies to all employers with at least 20 employees. The Act prohibits covered employers from discriminating in employment against any individual who is at least 40 years of age. In 1989, the Supreme Court held in Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts that the ADEA, nevertheless, did not prohibit discrimination in employee benefits, such as health insurance. In response to the Supreme Court decision in Betts, Congress enacted the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA) of 1990, which amended the ADEA to define “compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment” as including employee benefits.

<p align="justify">For many years there was little discussion about the interplay between the ADEA and retiree health benefits. Many employers relied on legislative history to the OWBPA that states that the practice of eliminating or reducing retiree health benefits upon Medicare eligibility is lawful under ADEA.

<p align="justify">In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in the case of Erie County Retirees Association v. County of Erie, became the first federal court of appeals to examine whether an employer’s coordination of its retiree health plans with Medicare eligibility violated the ADEA. The Third Circuit held that the legislative history was not controlling and that the ADEA prohibits an employer from treating retirees differently with respect to health benefits based on Medicare eligibility, unless the employer can meet one of the affirmative defenses provided in the ADEA, specifically the equal benefit/equal cost rule. This rule has been part of the ADEA’s regulatory framework since 1967. Department of Labor and EEOC regulations interpreted the ADEA as permitting employers to offer lower levels of certain employee benefits to older workers as long as the benefit costs incurred on behalf of older workers is no less than that incurred for younger workers. In the OWBPA, Congress adopted this test, thereby codifying the EEOC’s equal benefit/equal cost rule.

<p align="justify">The EEOC submitted an amicus curiae brief in Erie County, asserting, based on the plain language of the ADEA, that retirees are covered by the ADEA and employer reliance on Medicare eligibility in making determinations in employee benefits violated the ADEA, unless the employer satisfied one of the Act’s specified defenses or exemptions. In its October 2000 Compliance Manual chapter on employee benefits, the EEOC explicitly adopted the position taken by the Third Circuit in Erie County as its national enforcement policy. When the EEOC announced in August 2001 that it wished to study the relationship between the ADEA and retiree benefits, the EEOC unanimously voted to rescind those portions of its Compliance Manual that discussed the Erie County decision.

<p align="justify">In an attempt to comply with the court’s ruling, Erie County transferred younger retirees to an HMO that did not provide an out-of-network benefit. The county also required retirees not yet eligible for Medicare to pay a monthly amount equal to the Medicare Part B premium. The result, therefore, is a decrease in health benefits for retirees generally; older retirees receive no better benefits, while younger retirees must pay more for health benefits that offer fewer choices.

<p align="justify">When the Third Circuit held that the practice of coordinating retiree health benefits with Medicare eligibility was unlawful unless an employer could meet the equal benefit/equal cost test, there was widespread concern that employers who currently provide retiree health benefits would either have to provide greater benefits to older retirees or reduce benefits for younger retirees to comply. The EEOC believes that, if required to make a choice between paying more or less to comply with the ADEA, many employers will choose to pay less by reducing or eliminating health coverage for retirees who are not yet eligible for Medicare. This result in particularly likely given the rising costs of health care in general. The proposed exemption seeks to eliminate this incentive by clarifying that the ADEA permits employers to coordinate retiree health benefits with Medicare eligibility. This approach also benefits the significant number of employees who rely on retiree health coverage.

<p align="justify">The EEOC proposes a narrowly drawn exemption that permits the practice of coordinating retiree health benefits with eligibility for Medicare. The proposed exemption has no reporting requirements.

<p align="justify">The proposed exemption would become effective on the date of publication of a final rule in the Federal Register. The EEOC intends that the exemption apply to existing, as well as newly created, retiree health plans. The EEOC also intends that the exemption apply to dependent benefits.
