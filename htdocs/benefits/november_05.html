<b>Advisory Panel On Tax Reform Endorses Caps On Health Care Breaks</b>

<p align="justify">In a report released on November 1, the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform endorsed recommendations to "simplify" taxes for individuals and families. Among several changes in the two proposed alternative tax schemes are two major changes in the employee benefits field: a change to health savings plans such as Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and Health Reimbursement Arrangements, as well as caps on the tax exemptions for employees purchasing health care. 
 
<p align="justify">The panel's suggestion regarding health savings plans is to combine them with several other savings options, such as those for education and home purchase, into "Save for Family Accounts." Regarding the tax status of insurance premiums, the panel endorses allowing people to buy insurance with tax-free dollars up to a cap of $11,500 for families and $5,000 for individuals, which the panel estimates to be equal to average insurance premiums.
  
<p align="justify">Though it is not certain that any of these recommendations will be implemented in the near future, the employee benefits community is regarding them with seriousness, hoping that the community might be able to forestall such sweeping changes being incorporated into legislation any time soon.  

<p><b>IRS Releases 2006 Limits</b>

<p align="justify">In late October the IRS released the inflation-adjusted limits for many types of accounts, including HSAs. The numbers for 2006 are as follows:

<ul type="square"> 
<li>HSA Annual contribution levels: $2,700 for an individual, $5,450 for a family, and $700 catch-up contribution for those aged 55 and older,</li>  
<li>Maximum Out of Pocket for HSA-compatible high deductible health plans (HDHPs): $5,250 for individuals, $10,500 for families,</li>  
<li>Minimum Deductible for HSA HDHPs: $1,050 for individuals, $2,100 for families.</li>
</ul>
  
<p><b>DOL Opinion Letter On FMLA Allows Employers More Stringent Criteria</b>

<p align="justify">In an opinion letter released by the Department of Labor (DOL) late last month, the DOL drew a parallel between the recalculation of the 1,250 hours of service for FMLA eligibility for a given 12 month period and the possibility of requiring certification, rather than the simpler re-certification, of a medical condition, even if the condition has been confirmed in a previous leave year. This opinion letter applies to employees on intermittent leave. The DOL said the leave year may be calculated in one of four ways:

<ul type="square"> 
<li>a calendar year</li>
<li>any fixed 12-month leave year</li>
<li>a 12-month rolling period measured forward from the date an employee's first FMLA leave begins</li>
<li>or a rolling 12-month period measured back from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">The twelve month period must be applied consistently and uniformly to all employees. If an employee on intermittent leave asks for leave in a new leave year, the letter states, the employer has the right not only to ask for a certification of the condition, but can also ask for second and third opinions. If a third opinion is requested, it is binding. Second and third opinions are to be paid for by the employer.  
 
<p><b>House Ways And Means Approves $500 FSA Rollover</b>

<p align="justify">Though the House Ways and Means Committee has approved an annual $500 Flexible Spending Account rollover, it is uncertain whether the provision will survive the Senate process. Senator Jim DeMint (R-SC) has sponsored this measure on the Senate side and is currently seeking co-sponsors. 
 
<p><b>HSA Acceptance Study Released By University Of Minnesota</b>

<p align="justify">University of Minnesota researchers reported this month that potential tax subsidies for Health Savings Accounts are likely to increase the acceptance of the accounts by consumers. The study forecast that approximately 3.2 million HSAs would be opened in  2005, by people between the ages of 19 and 64 who are not students, public health program participants or eligible for group coverage as a dependent. Tax credit proposals by the Bush administration could lead to a doubling of the number of accounts opened and a reduction in the number of uninsured in the US by 2.9 million. 
 
<p align="justify">In other HSA news, HSA Bank reports that, of the more than 60,000 new accounts opened in 2005, more than 92% of account holders are saving all or part of their contributed funds. At the end of the third quarter, the bank reports, the average balance of the nearly 127,000 accounts was $1,570.  

<p><b>US District Court Rules On Terminated, Then Deceased, Employee</b>

<p align="justify">The US District Court for Massachusetts ruled that an employee who quit her job five days before she died was no longer eligible for a death benefit even though the entire month's premium had been deducted from her pay. In a decision against the employee's husband, Chief Judge William Young said that the plan documents were clear that coverage ends when an employee terminates employment.  

<p><b>HHS Absolved Of HIPAA Violation In "Routine Use" Rules</b>

<p align="justify">The 3rd District Court of Appeals ruled this month that the US Department of Health and Human Services violated neither HIPAA privacy regulations nor the US Constitution in amending HIPAA privacy rules to allow for "routine use" disclosures of protected health information without consent. The appellate court agreed with the District Court on this point and added that uncontested PHI disclosures are not subject to the Constitution, as they are not actions of the government.  

<p><b>EBRI Research Shows Statistics On Covered Populations</b>

<p align="justify">In a new study by the Employee Benefit Research Institute released this month, the organization reports that the percentage of residents under 65 with health insurance hit a ten-year high in 2004, 82.2%. The study also showed changes in the number of people with employer-based insurance, which rose steadily from 1997 to 2000, and has declined each year since. While the percentage of individuals living in the United States who are insured was 64% in 2000, it was just under 60% in 2004. The study also shows that the rate of uninsured in the US remained stable at about 16%, with the decline in employer-based coverage compensated for through an increase in government-sponsored coverage.
  
<p><b>EBSA Extends Time To Make Health Care Decisions In Wake Of Katrina</b>

<p align="justify">The DOL's Employee Benefits Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service last month released a notice extending the deadline for Katrina victims to make important healthcare decisions from January 3, 2006 to February 28, 2006. This extension applies to decisions regarding the exercising of health coverage portability or continuation coverage rights. The extension also applies to filing or continuing processes regarding health care claims.
