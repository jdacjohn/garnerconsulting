<b>New HIPAA Portability Rules Published, More In The Works</b>

<p align="justify">On December 30, 2004, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services and the IRS published new portability regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). These expand on interim regulations published in 1997. The new regulations require that an “educational statement” be sent along with the certificate of credible coverage for beneficiaries whose coverage is terminated. The regulations provide model language for this statement, as well as for the notice of special enrollment rights that must be given to all eligible employees and a general notice of preexisting condition exclusion. Additional changes include: 

<ul type="square">

<li>Requiring written procedures for obtaining certificates</li>

<li>Recognizing foreign government plans as creditable coverage</li>

<li>Clarifying the definition of a preexisting condition; for example, an exclusion for any prosthesis if the body part was lost before the effective date of coverage would be considered a preexisting condition exclusion and subject to the limitations on such exclusions.  Also a provision that only provides coverage for cosmetic surgery in cases of accidental injury only if the injury occurred while covered under the plan or a provision that only provides coverage for congenital defects if the individual has been continuously covered under the plan since birth</li>

<li>Specifying that lifetime limits for specific conditions that count benefits provided under prior health coverage are preexisting condition exclusions and are subject to the HIPAA limitations on such exclusions</li>

<li>Clarifying that a plan cannot impose any time limit for presenting a certificate of creditable coverage</li>

<li>Clarifying that a special enrollment right exists even if an individual who lost coverage elects COBRA and that the individual has a second special enrollment right upon exhausting COBRA</li>

<li>Clarifying that if an individual reaches a lifetime maximum on all benefits, there is a loss of eligibility for coverage for special enrollment purposes</li>

<li>Adding new rules defining limited scope dental and vision benefits and regarding health flexible spending accounts</li>

<li>Clarifying special rules for partnerships</li>

<li>Establishing special enrollment rights for participants to change among available coverage options under a group health plan when adding a dependent in connection with marriage, adoption or placement for adoption</li>

<li>Clarifying that a plan must provide the general notice of preexisting conditions as part of any written application for enrollment</li>

<li>Specifying that for individuals who elect COBRA during the second election period provided under the Trade Act of 2002, the days between the date the individual lost group health plan coverage and the first day of the second COBRA election period are not taken into account in determining whether a significant break in coverage has occurred.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">The regulations will become effective for plan years starting on or after July 1, 2005.

<p align="justify">New regulations are also in the works, which would further modify the break in coverage and special enrollment rules. Also, workers who have not received a certificate will be eligible for an extension of up to 44 days. 

<p><b>DOL Issues Advisory On Cash Incentives For HSAs</b>

<p align="justify">On December 30, 2004 the Department of Labor issued an advisory stating that it is not illegal for trustees or custodians to offer cash incentives to individuals opening Health Savings Accounts. Using the example of a bank contracted by an insurer to act as trustee or custodian and recordkeeper for HSAs, the DOL stated that it is not against the law for the bank to make a contribution to each account as a bonus. 

<p align="justify">The IRS expressly allows any person to make contributions to an HSA on the eligible individual’s behalf, and the DOL determined that though the insurer and the bank would be considered “disqualified persons” under the IRS code’s prohibited transaction rules, such a cash contribution would not be barred under the code section 4975(c)(1). 

<p align="justify">In addition, the Department stated that the account holder would not be engaging in prohibited self-dealing, as the contribution is to the HSA rather than directly to the account holder. The DOL also stated that this analysis would be valid under ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules.
