<strong>Tax Relief And Health Care Act Loosens Up HSA Restrictions</strong>

<p align="justify">Published on December 13, 2006, the Tax Relief and Healthcare Act of 2006 makes several changes that affect HSAs, which are greeted positively by the insurance industry. These changes include a one-time FSA to HSA rollover, some flexibility regarding FSA grace periods, a repeal of the annual deductible limitation, earlier indexing of cost of living adjustments, the possibility of contributing up to the full annual limit for partial year eligibility, and a one-time IRA to HSA rollover. The act also extended mental health parity requirements.</p>

<p align="justify">The one-time FSA to HSA rollover is allowed between the date of enactment and January 1, 2012. It allows certain amounts in a health FSA or HRA to be transferred directly to an HSA, as long as the amount is no more than the lesser of: 1) the balance of the account as of September 21, 2006 or 2) the balance of the account as of the date of the distribution.</p>

<p align="justify">For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, employees whose employers allow an FSA grace period will not be considered ineligible to contribute to HSAs during the grace period, provided that the balance in the FSA at the end of the plan year is zero, or the employee contributes the remaining FSA balance to the HSA, as described above.</p>

<p align="justify">The maximum monthly contribution for HSAs is no longer 1/12 of the annual deductible (up to $2,850 for individual coverage in 2007), but rather 1/12 of up to $2,850. Therefore, even if the annual deductible is lower than $2,850 for individual coverage or $5,650 for family coverage, participants can make a total annual contribution up to these indexed limits.</p>

<p align="justify">Cost of living adjustments have heretofore been calculated based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as of the close of the 12-month period ending August 31 of the calendar year. These adjustments will now be made based on the CPI as of the close of the 12 months ending March 31 of the calendar year.</p>

<p align="justify">Contributions up to the full annual limit will now be allowed even for participants who are not eligible for the full year. Certain conditions must be met. If the participant is not eligible for the entire 12-month testing period, however, the contributions made before the participant becomes ineligible will be attributable to the participant’s gross income. The testing period is defined as the period beginning with the last month of the taxable year and ending on the last day of the 12<sup>th</sup> month following that first month. If the participant becomes ineligible due to death or disability, however, an exception applies.</p>

<p align="justify">Comparability rules for employer contributions have been modified to allow employers to make larger HSA contributions for non-highly compensated employees than for highly compensated employees (HCEs). While the employer must still make comparable contributions to all non-HCEs with comparable coverage during a particular period, this change allows employers to contribute only on behalf of non-HCEs.</p>

<p align="justify">One-time rollovers are also being allowed from an IRA to an HSA, for tax years beginning in 2007. The contribution must be made directly, trustee to trustee.</p>

<p align="justify">In addition, federal law states that group health plans cannot impose aggregate lifetime or annual benefit limits on mental health benefits if such limits are not imposed on medical and surgical benefits as well. These requirements, which were scheduled to expire on December 31, 2006, were extended by the Act through December 31, 2007.</p>

<p><strong>Transition Relief Approved For Debit Card Regulations</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On December 15, 2006, the Department of Treasury released transition relief for its previously announced health FSA debit card ruling. Rather than require that non-health care related merchants (such as grocery stores which also have a pharmacy) have an inventory control system in order to be able to process debit card transactions, the Department has relaxed that requirements until January 1, 2008. Likewise, debit card purchases will be allowed at drug stores and pharmacies through December 31, 2008, after which the store will need to have an inventory control system or have 90% of all gross receipts in qualified medical expenses.</p>  

<p><strong>2007 Medicare Premiums, Deductibles, Other Amounts Announced</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have announced the pertinent numbers for 2007 Medicare participants. The new amounts are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Court Strikes Objection To Rx Companies’ Canadian Drug Blockade</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The 8<sup>th</sup> US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on December 4, 2006, that pharmaceutical companies did not violate antitrust laws in cooperating to block the importation of drugs from Canada. Because the importation of Canadian prescription drugs has not been approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the court ruled that the plaintiffs’ claim that drug companies had banded together to thwart a legal source of prescriptions was not factual.</p>  

<p align="justify">The court’s ruling stated that “the absence of competition from Canadian drug sources in the domestic prescription drug market . . . is caused by the federal statutory and regulatory scheme adopted by the United States Government, not by the conduct of the defendants.</p>

<p><strong>District Court Rules On Accidental Nature Of Death In Hospital Bed</strong></p>
 
<p align="justify">The US District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin ruled on December 14, 2006, to deny accidental death benefits to the beneficiaries of a woman who died the first night she slept in a hospital bed at home. The court noted that, while some circuits have interpreted strictly the requirements of most AD&amp;D plans that an accident be independent of other causes, others have taken a more moderate stance and determined that disease only negates the accidental nature of a death if it contributes “substantially” to the loss. In this case, though the woman’s body was found with her feet tangled in the bed rails, the court found that the medical examiner’s finding of death due to natural causes was correct, and the woman’s beneficiary was denied AD&amp;D benefits.</p>
