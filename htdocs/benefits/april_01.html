<b>Privacy Regulations Take Effect</b> 

<p>On April 12, 2001, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson announced that the privacy regulations would take effect as scheduled. There had been prior indications that the regulations would be delayed as changes were made to reduce the difficulty of complying with the complex new rules. When announcing that the regulations would be effective on April 14, 2001, with compliance required two years after the effective date, Thompson said that the rule would be modified in the following ways:

<ul type="square">
<li>Doctors and hospitals will have access to necessary medical information about a patient they are treating and they will be able to consult with other physicians and specialists regarding a patient's care.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Patient care will be delivered in a timely and efficient manner and not unduly hampered by the confusing requirements surrounding consent forms. For example, pharmacists will be able to fill prescriptions over the phone and serve their customers in a timely manner.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Parents will have access to information about the health and well being of their children, including information about mental health, substance abuse or abortion.</li></ul>
 
<p>The new regulations only apply to health plans and do not regulate life, disability or workers' compensation programs. Employers are not considered "covered entities" under the regulations, but the health plans they sponsor are subject to the regulations. The regulations define a "hybrid entity" as a single legal entity that is a covered entity but whose covered functions are not its primary functions. Most employers will fall into this category, since the health plans they sponsor are covered by the new regulations. The final regulations impose ten new requirements on health plan sponsors. They are to:

<ul type="square">
<li>Ensure that any protected health information is not used or disclosed other than as permitted under the regulations or required by law.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Ensure that any agents or subcontractors to whom protected health information is provided agree to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to the plan sponsor.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Ensure that any protected health information is not used for any employment-related decisions or actions or in connection with any other benefit.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Report to the group health any use or disclosure that is inconsistent with the regulations, if the plan sponsor is aware of the inappropriate use or disclosure.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Make protected health information available to individuals, as required by the access rules in the new regulations.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Make protected health information available to individuals as required by the rules in the new regulations that allow individuals to amend protected health information.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Make protected health information available to individuals in accordance with the rule in the new regulations that requires an accounting to individuals of disclosures of protected health information.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Make its internal practices, books and records relating to the use and disclosure of protected health information received from the group health plan to the government for purposes of determining compliance.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Return or destroy all protected health information received from the group health plan that the plan sponsor maintains in any form and retain no copies when no longer needed for the purpose for which the disclosure was made. If return or destruction is not feasible, the plan sponsor must limit further uses and disclosures to those purposes that make the return or destruction not feasible.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Provide for adequate separation between the group health plan and the plan sponsor.</li></ul>

<p>Plan documents must be amended to reflect all of the above requirements. The last item means that the plan documents must also be amended to:

<ul type="square">
<li>Describe those employees or classes of employees or other persons under the control of the plan sponsor to be given access to protected health information.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Restrict access to and use by these people to the plan administration functions that the plan sponsor performs.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Provide an effective mechanism for resolving any noncompliance by these people.</li></ul>
