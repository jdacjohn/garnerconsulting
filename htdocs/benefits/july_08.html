<p><strong>HOUSE PASSES BILL EXPANDING COVERAGE FOR ILL STUDENTS</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On July 30, 2008, the US House of Representatives passed H.R. 2851, affecting when coverage
for a dependent child can be terminated under the parent’s medical plan.</p> 

<p align="justify">Known as Michelle’s Law, medical plans will be prohibited from terminating coverage of a
dependent child due to a medically necessary leave of absence from a postsecondary education
institution or any other change in enrollment at that institution. “Medically Necessary” is defined
as a severe illness or injury that causes the child to lose full-time student status before the earlier
of one year after the first day of the leave or the date on which coverage would otherwise
terminate under the plan. A severe illness or injury requires certification by the child’s physician
who will also determine the date the leave begins.</p>

<p align="justify">Michelle’s Law amends The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Public
Health Service Act and the Internal Revenue Code and will apply to group (whether insured or
self-funded) as well as individual medical plans. The effective date would be for medically
necessary leaves beginning in plan years one year after the date the President signs the
Legislation. There’s no effective date exception for Collective Bargaining Agreements in the
current legislation.</p>

<p align="justify">Children are generally dropped from their parent’s health insurance plan’s at age 18 or 19 or at
age 24 or 25 if full time students at an accredited college. New Jersey requires coverage for
children up to age 30 as long as they have no dependents of their own. At least four States also
recognize grandchildren as dependents. It’s evident that coverage for dependent children is
rapidly expanding at the state and federal level. It’s too early to assess the cost impact of
Michelle’s Law.</p>

<p><strong>CONGRESS OVERRIDES VETO OF MEDICARE BILL</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On July 15, 2008, the US Congress overrode the President’s veto of the Medicare Improvement
for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, which makes a number of changes to Medicare,
including</p>

<p align="justify">
<li>Changing the rules regarding coverage of preventive services. Previously, it literally
took an act of Congress to cover a preventive service. Now, the Secretary of Health
and Human Services can decide which preventive services will be covered under
Medicare;</li>
<li>Gradually reducing copayments for psychiatric services;</li>
<li>Increasing physicians’ payments;</li>
<li>Providing incentives for electronic prescriptions;</li>
<li>Providing coverage for cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation;</li>
<li>Revising requirements for Medicare Advantage private fee-for-service plans.</li>
</p>



<p><strong>IRS ISSUES GUIDANCE RELATED TO HDHPs AND HSAs</strong></p>



<p align="justify">On June 3, 2008, the IRS released Notice 2008-52 providing guidance on the tax implications for
people who only have a high deductible health plan (HDHP) for part of a year. There is a
“testing period” that begins on the first day of the last month of the taxable year and ends on the
last day of the 12th month following that month. For a calendar year taxpayer, the testing period
begins on December 1 and ends on December 31 of the next year.</p>  



<p align="justify">If an individual who is eligible to establish an Health Savings Account (HSA) on the first day of
the testing period ceases to be eligible later in the testing period (other than due to disability or
death), contributions to the HSA in excess of the sum of the monthly contribution limits will be
included in income and subject to an additional 10% tax.</p> 


<p align="justify">On July 21, 2008, the IRS released Notice 2008-59 providing guidance on a number of issues
related to HSAs. Among other things, the guidance indicates that if an individual switches from
a family HDHP to a self-only HDHP, the self-only HDHP may use any reasonable method to
allocate the covered expenses incurred during the period of family coverage for the purpose of
satisfying the deductible for self-only coverage.</p>


<p><strong>2009 LIMITS FOR HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On June 2, 2008, the IRS announced the following cost-of-living adjustments for 2009 related to
HSAs:</p>
