<strong>District Court Orders Benefit Payments For Non-Union Workers</strong>

<p align="justify">On July 18<sup>th</sup> the US District Court for the Western District of New York ruled that even non-union employees should receive the same benefits as union employees of the same company. In a suit brought by the Laborers International Union of North America, Local 210, the union stated that it should have received benefit payments for non-union workers in the same manner as it does for union workers, and the employer countered that it had paid the non-union employees directly. An audit showed that almost $400,000 was owed in delinquent benefit contributions, which the court awarded to the non-union employees. Most significant in this decision is the opinion by the court that a collective bargaining agreement that applies to employees by classification applies to all employees, union and non-union.</p>

<p><strong>Fiduciary Breach Claim Struck Down In COLI Case</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The 5<sup>th</sup> US Circuit Court of Appeals determined on July 19<sup>th</sup> that an employee’s claim that his employer breached fiduciary duty when it used his personal information to purchase a company-owned life insurance policy (COLI) was not supported by the evidence. The opinion stated that his assertion of identity misappropriation was not valid, since the purchase of the policy in no way decreased the value of his identity, and did not prevent him from purchasing his own life insurance policy. Second, the court also ruled that the employee had failed to prove a fiduciary duty not to disclose his personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Plan Administrator Not Arbitrary In Stomach Reduction Denial</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On July 17<sup>th</sup> the US District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee ruled that a group health plan administrator was within its rights and within reason when it denied a LAP Band surgery to a participant with a diagnosis of morbid obesity. The plan administrator, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee (BCBS), had interpreted the plan document language to mean that such treatment is allowable for participants who are obese for at lease five <em>consecutive</em> years, though this was not explicitly stated in the plan. The court ruled that it was reasonable for BCBS to interpret it that way. Since the participant in question had failed to provide doctors’ statements as to her weight over the previous five years, the court further stated that “ERISA does not require plan administrators to accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians, particularly where there is credible, reliable evidence that conflicts with the treating physician’s opinions.”</p>

<p><strong>Yet Another Court Weighs In On Drunkenness And Accidents</strong></p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">The US District Court for the District of Colorado ruled in June that a 2004 fatal accident, in which the driver’s blood-alcohol level was over twice the legal limit, was still an accident. Ruling against Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., Judge Marcia S. Krieger stated that a reasonable person in the driver’s position would have understood the word “accident” to apply to an event involving the vehicle, and not the cause of the event, such as drunkenness. Also noting that the evidence did not support a firm conclusion that the driver’s intoxication was responsible for the event, the judge ordered the life insurance company to pay accidental death and dismemberment benefits to the driver’s parents, in addition to the life benefits previously paid.</p>

<p align="justify">This decision is yet another opinion in the ongoing debate as to whether intoxication invalidates the accidental nature of vehicle mishaps, and so far the opinions seem to be split.</p>

<p><strong>Tax Incentives For Employer Sponsored Wellness Proposed</strong></p>

<p align="justify">Senators Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Gordon Smith (R-Oregon) introduced The Healthy Workforce Act (SB 1753) in July, legislation that would grant employers tax credits of up to $200 per employee for sponsoring employee wellness programs. The programs must include three of the following four elements in order to qualify for the credits:</p>

<ul type="square">
<li>Health awareness, including education and health risk assessments;</li>
<li>Behavioral change, such as classes, counseling or online programs;</li>
<li>Supportive environment, including meaningful incentives to participate;</li>
<li>An employee committee which would tailor the program to the needs of the population.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">Employers could claim $200 per employee for the first 200 employees, and $100 per employee above that number, each year for the 10 years after the establishment of the wellness program.</p>

<p><strong>Senators Propose Paid FMLA</strong></p>

<p align="justify">In late June Senators Chris Dodd (D-Connecticut) and Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) introduced The Family Leave Insurance Fund Act (bill number not yet assigned) to create a fund to finance paid leaves via FMLA. The law would allow for reimbursement to employers for up to eight weeks of leave pay.  Employers and employees would be required to pay premiums of about 0.2% of the employee’s earnings, and employees would only be entitled to benefits after they have worked and paid premiums for 12 months.</p>

<p align="justify">The program would be mandatory for all businesses with over 50 employees, but companies would have the choice to self-insure if they already offer better benefits. Smaller businesses would have the right to join the program with a 50% premium discount. Benefits would range from 100% salary replacement down to 40%, depending on income level.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Would Make Domestic Partner Coverage Tax-Free</strong></p>

<p align="justify">Senators Gordon Smith (R-Oregon) and Joseph Lieberman (D-Connecticut) introduced a bill, the Tax Equity for Domestic Partner and Health Plan Beneficiaries Act (SB 1556), in June that would make employer contributions toward domestic partner benefits tax free, as are contributions for spouses. The corresponding House bill, the Tax Equity for Health Plan Beneficiaries Act of 2007, was introduced by Jim McDermott, (D-Washington). Both bills are currently under consideration.</p>
