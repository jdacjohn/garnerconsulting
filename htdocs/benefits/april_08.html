<strong>PROPOSED TAXPAYER ASSISTANCE MAY EQUAL TAXPAYER HEADACHES</strong>

<p align="justify">On April 15, 2008, the House of Representatives passed, on a largely partisan vote, the “Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act.”  This bill, authored by Rep. Charles Rangel (D-NY) would, among other things, limit the tax exclusion for distributions from a health savings account (HSA) to qualified medical expenses that are substantiated according to the rules governing flexible spending arrangements (FSAs).  By placing the burden for substantiating HSA distributions on the HSA trustee or custodian (typically banks), Rep. Rangel’s bill would likely increase the cost of HSA administration.   </p>

<p align="justify">Current guidance requires the HSA account holder to self-report any distributions not used for qualified medical expenses and to provide the IRS with documentation upon request.  Under the House bill, HSA trustees/custodians would be obligated to request substantiation at the time of the requested distribution in order to meet the reporting obligations required by the bill.  In addition HSA trustees/custodians would be required to report to the IRS and the account holder the total amount of non-substantiated distributions by January 15 for the prior tax year.  Some analysts are concerned that the substantiation requirements in the House bill will impose significant transaction costs on HSA trustees/custodians causing them to be less attractive to individuals looking for ways to manage health care costs.   </p>


<strong>REGULATIONS FINALIZED ON HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT COMPARABILITY</strong>

<p align="justify">On April 17, 2008, the IRS published final regulations on comparability of employer contributions to HSAs.  The IRS published more extensive final regulations in 2006, but at that time did not address the issue of employees who have not established an HSA by the end of the calendar year. </p>

<p align="justify">In 2007, the IRS proposed regulations addressing this issue and one additional issue concerning the acceleration of employer contributions. The final regulations just published adopt the provisions of the proposed regulations without substantive revision.  </p>

<p align="justify">The proposed and final regulations provide a means for employers to comply with the comparability requirements with respect to employees who have not established an HSA by December 31, as well as with respect to employees who may have established an HSA but not notified the employer of that fact. The proposed and final regulations provide that, in order to comply with the comparability rules, the employer must comply with a notice requirement and a contribution requirement.  In order to comply with the notice requirement, the employer must provide all affected employees, by January 15 of the following calendar year, written notice that each eligible employee who, by the last day of February, both establishes an HSA and notifies the employer that he or she has established the HSA will receive a comparable contribution to the HSA.  For each such eligible employee who establishes an HSA and so notifies the employer by the end of February, the employer must contribute to the HSA by April 15 comparable amounts plus reasonable interest.  The notice may be delivered electronically.  The proposed and final regulations provide sample language that employers may use as a basis in preparing their own notices. </p>

<p align="justify">The proposed and final regulations also address a second issue relating to acceleration of contributions.  They provide that an employer may accelerate part or all of its contributions for the entire year to the HSAs of employees who have incurred qualified medical expenses exceeding the employer's cumulative HSA contributions at that time.  If an employer accelerates contributions for this reason, these contributions must be available on an equal basis to all eligible employees throughout the calendar year and employers must establish reasonable methods and requirements for acceleration of contributions and the determination of medical expenses.  An employer is not required to contribute interest on either accelerated or non-accelerated HSA contributions. </p>

<p align="justify">These regulations apply to employer contributions made for calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2009.  However, employers may rely on this guidance beginning on or after the date of publication of these final regulations in the Federal Register (April 17, 2008). </p>


<strong>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ISSUES REGULATIONS ON TRICARE</strong>

<p align="justify">On March 28, 2008, the Department of Defense published proposed regulations setting rules regarding what employers can and cannot offer to employees who are eligible for TRICARE, the health plan for active and retired members of the military and their families.  In 2006, Congress passed legislation that prohibits employers from offering financial or other incentives to certain TRICARE-eligible employees not to enroll in an employer group health plan.</p>

<p align="justify">These regulations clarify that certain common employer benefits programs do not constitute improper incentives under the law. For example, cash or supplemental insurance offered under an employer's cafeteria plan which complies with section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code would not be considered improper, as long as it is not limited to TRICARE participants.</p>
