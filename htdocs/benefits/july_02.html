<b>Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRA)</b>

<p align="justify">On June 26, 2002, the IRS issued guidance in the form of a Revenue Ruling (2002-41) and a Notice (2002-45) concerning the tax treatment of certain employer-funded health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) that permit participants to carry over unused employer contributions into subsequent plan years. In anticipation of annual double-digit inflationary increases in the cost of group health insurance, employers will be evaluating HRAs as an option to offer to their employees. An HRA with a carry over feature may be offered on a tax-favored basis if the following conditions are satisfied:

<ol type="1">

<li>The HRA must be funded <u>solely</u> with employer contributions;</li>

<li>The HRA may only be used to reimburse employees, former employees (including retirees) and/or their tax dependents for medical care expenses as defined under Code Section 213, which includes health insurance premium/contributions and reimbursement of otherwise unreimbursed medical expenses; and</li>

<li>While the HRA may be offered in conjunction with a cafeteria plan (e.g. the HRA may be combined with a high deductible health plan that is paid for in part with employee pre-tax contributions made through a cafeteria plan), no part of the HRA may be attributable to pre-tax salary reductions.</li>

</ol>

<p align="justify">These plans must comply with COBRA and HIPAA Regulations.

<p align="justify">With HRAs employers can be creative in designing health plans to meet employees' needs and control costs. HRAs offer employers one tool to combat rising health benefit costs. By combining an HRA with a high deductible plan, employers can provide employees with incentives to make wise choices about using medical services. The following is an example of a common arrangement for HRAs:

<p align="justify">
The employer provides active or retired employees with a high deductible health plan coupled with an account that can be used to pay medical expenses that are not covered by the health plan, such as the deductible amount. Health premiums can also be paid from this account. Amounts that are not used in one year may be carried forward to the next year. Sometimes these accounts are called "Personal Care Accounts".

<p align="justify">The HRA may also be offered in addition to a Section 125 health Flexible Spending Account (FSA). In that case, if the HRA and the FSA cover the same medical expenses, the HRA must be exhausted before expenses may be reimbursed by the FSA. However if an HRA is structured so that it is not available for reimbursements covered by the FSA, then those expenses may be reimbursed first from the FSA and then from the HRA after the FSA balance is exhausted. FSA balances are subject to 'the use it or lose it' rule.

<p align="justify">To qualify for the exclusions under Code Sections 105 and 106, an HRA may only provide benefits that reimburse expenses for medical care as defined in Code Section 213(d). Each medical care expense submitted for reimbursement must be substantiated. An HRA may not reimburse a medical care expense that is attributable to a deduction allowed for any prior taxable year. Additionally, an HRA may neither reimburse a medical care expense that is incurred before the date the HRA is in existence nor reimburse a medical care expense that is incurred before the date an employee first becomes enrolled under the HRA. Reimbursements for insurance covering medical care expenses as defined in Code Section 213(d)(1)(D) are allowable reimbursements under an HRA, including amounts paid for premiums for accident or health coverage for current employees, retirees, and COBRA qualified beneficiaries. Reimbursements of medical care expenses may not include expenses for qualified long-term care services as defined in Code Section 7702B(c).

<p align="justify">An HRA does not qualify for the exclusion under Code Section 105(b) if any person has the right to receive cash or any other taxable or nontaxable benefit under the arrangement other than the reimbursement of medical care expenses. If any person has such a right under an arrangement currently or in any future year, all distributions to all persons made from the arrangement in the current tax year have to be included in gross income, even amounts paid to reimburse medical care expenses. For example, if an arrangement pays a death benefit without regard to medical care expenses, no amounts paid under the arrangement to any person are excluded under Code Section 105(b).

<p align="justify">An HRA may continue to reimburse former employees or retired employees for medical care expenses after termination of employment or retirement (even if the employee does not elect COBRA continuation coverage). For example, an HRA may have a provision that reimburses a former employee for medical care expenses only up to an amount equal to the unused reimbursement amount remaining at retirement or other termination of employment. The plan may also provide that the maximum reimbursement amount available after retirement or other termination of employment is reduced for any administrative costs of continuing such coverage. Additionally, an HRA may or may not provide for an increase in the amount available for reimbursement of medical care expenses after the employee retires or otherwise terminates employment (even if the employee does not elect COBRA continuation coverage).

<p align="justify">The current HRA ruling is an important first step towards a more consumer driven health care system. It will take some time to get employers and employees comfortable with the arrangement. Communication material must be clear and extensive to help modify consumer behavior.
