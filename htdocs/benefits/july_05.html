<b>Protective Orders Don't Trigger COBRA Qualifying Event</b>

<p align="justify">The US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled on July 11, 2005 that protective orders issued during divorce proceedings do not constitute a "legal separation" triggering Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) notification requirements (<i>Simpson v. T.D. Williamson Inc.</i>, 10<sup>th</sup> Cir., No. 04-5084, 7/11/05).

<p align="justify">The court said that a "legal separation," and thus a "qualifying event," occurs within the meaning of COBRA Sections 601(a) and 603(3) only when a court issues a final decree adjudicating the parties' legal rights and obligations while preserving the marriage bond.

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">Divorce or legal separation of a covered employee from the employee's spouse constitutes a "qualifying event" under COBRA Section 603(3), triggering the obligation of the plan administrator to notify the covered employee of the right to continued coverage.

<p><b>Federal Court Rules In Favor Of Women In Contraceptive Coverage Suit</b>

<p align="justify">US District Court Judge Laurie Smith Camp, for the District of Nebraska, ruled on July 26, 2005 that Union Pacific Railroad's exclusion of prescription contraceptives and related services from its health plans constitutes sexual discrimination. She ruled that the exclusion was a violation of Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 "because it treats medical care women need to prevent pregnancy less favorably than it treats medical care needed to prevent other medical conditions that are no greater threat to employees' health than is pregnancy." 

<p align="justify">Regarding the company's argument that since fertility, conception, and pregnancy in a female is normal, contraception is not medically necessary, Smith Camp created a scenario of a hypothetical disease with similar pains and discomforts as pregnancy and childbirth. 

<p align="justify">The decision comes as the latest in a long battle for the coverage of contraception by employer-sponsored health plans. In 2000 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued an official enforcement policy statement that said an employer's failure to cover prescription contraceptives, when it covers other prescription drugs and devices used to prevent illness or disease, is sex discrimination. Though contraception coverage is mandated in many states, there is little regulation at the federal level.

<p><b>Department Of Labor Issues Extension In 5500 Filing Due To Dennis</b> 

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">The U. S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration announced on July 17, 2005, an extension of the deadline for filing Form 5500 and Form 5500 EZ annual report/returns due to damages from Hurricane Dennis in Alabama. 

<p align="justify">The extension applies to plan administrators, employers and other entities located in areas directly affected, as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The extension also applies to firms located outside the affected areas who are unable to obtain the necessary information from service providers, banks or insurance companies whose operations were directly affected by the hurricane. 

<p align="justify">Under this relief, Form 5500 series filings required to be filed between July 10, 2005, and Sept. 12, 2005, are granted an extension until Sept. 12, 2005. Plan filers entitled to an extension of relief should check Part I, Box D on the Form 5500 or Part 1 on Form 5500-EZ and attach a statement to the form in accordance with the instructions.

<p><b>8<sup>th</sup> Circuit Rules On FMLA Notice</b> 

<p align="justify">On June 7, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled that an employee who failed to give proper notice regarding his need for leave was not protected by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). The employee said that he was "stressed" and needed time off. The company gave him numerous opportunities to submit the proper documentation, but when he failed to do so, he was terminated for excessive absences. The court ruled that the employee never properly explained why he needed the leave and that his explanations were not enough of a basis to determine FMLA eligibility. The case is <i>Woods v. DaimlerChrysler Corp.</i>, 8<sup>th</sup> Cir., No. 04-1065, 6/7/05. 

<p><b>9<sup>th</sup> Circuit Court Rules On FMLA Care</b>

<p align="justify">On July 12, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that "care" under the FMLA requires some actual care. On July 5, 2000, H. Charles Tellis contacted the Alaska Airlines benefits office to request FMLA leave because his wife was having difficulties with her pregnancy. The benefits office sent him the appropriate forms. On July 6, Tellis's vehicle broke down. He also owned a car in Atlanta and decided to fly there and drive it back to Seattle. He left for Atlanta on July 6 and returned to Seattle on July 10. His wife gave birth on July 9.

<p align="justify">Tellis had requested three days of leave and his next scheduled shift was July 11. When Tellis was absent without having obtained the required advance approval, Alaska Airlines attempted to contact him without success. Alaska Airlines terminated Tellis on July 18 for his unexcused absences. Tellis filed suit, arguing that his cross-country trip to retrieve a car and calling his wife on the phone during that trip were "to care for" his wife and thus a protected absence under FMLA. He argued that retrieving the car provided psychological reassurance to his wife that she would soon have reliable transportation and that his phone calls provided moral support and psychological comfort. The Circuit Court disagreed and held that as a matter of law, providing care to a family member under the FMLA requires some actual care. The case is <i>Tellis v. Alaska Airlines</i>, 9<sup>th</sup> Cir., No. 04-35137, 7/12/05.
