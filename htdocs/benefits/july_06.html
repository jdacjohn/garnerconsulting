<strong>Retailers Challenge Maryland Health Care Law</strong>

<p align="justify">In mid&ndash;June the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which includes Wal&ndash;Mart, brought a suit against the state of Maryland, saying that only the federal government can regulate private companies’ health spending. The association is represented by the son of Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
The judge in the case, J. Frederick Motz, declared that he found the state’s ideas for compliance with the new law&ndash;allowing for Wal&ndash;Mart to open first&ndash;aid clinics rather than increase health care offered to employees&ndash;“silly.” There is no deadline for Motz to issue a ruling.</p>

<p><strong>DOL Revamps Voluntary Compliance Program</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The Department of Labor (DoL) has announced expansion and enhancement of the Voluntary Fiduciary Compliance Program (VCFP), which allows plan sponsors to correct fiduciary breaches and prohibited transactions.</p>

<p align="justify">As of May 19, the program now covers 19 transactions that might need correcting, offers a model application form, has reduced documentation requirements, and includes simplified calculations and an internet tool for calculating lost earnings or profits. Even more importantly, the DoL has explicitly offered relief from civil penalties imposed under ERISA section 502(i). This is a significant enhancement to the program’s ability to entice plan sponsors to tattle on themselves, as the DoL is otherwise allowed to asses a 5% penalty on all prohibited transactions.</p>

<p><strong>GASB Releases Part D Guidance</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) has released guidance to clarify how government bodies should report payments to plan sponsors under the Medicare Part D Retiree Drug Subsidy (RDS). The technical bulletin, which was released in early July, clarifies</p>

<ul type="square">
<li>how a plan sponsor should report RDS payments,</li> 
<li>how the payments affect the accounting for reporting purposes by affected plans,</li> 
<li>how the sponsor should account for such payments to the plan,</li> 
<li>and how a defined benefit Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) plan should account for such payments.</li></ul>

<p><strong>New Hampshire Moves To Cover Sick College Kids</strong></p>

<p align="justify">In early July the governor of New Hampshire, John Lynch, signed a bill called “Michelle’s Law,” creating a possibility for college students to retain coverage under their parents’ health plans for up to 12 months while on a medical leave of absence from school. Named after a college student who struggled to stay in school full time while fighting cancer so that she could maintain coverage, the law applies only to fully insured policies and health maintenance organizations. Insurers will be allowed to require a doctor’s certification of medical necessity for the leave of absence.</p>

<p><strong>Texas House Representative Introduces HSA Bill</strong></p>

<p align="justify">In mid&ndash;June Congressman Sam Johnson introduced a bill that would allow families who buy health insurance on the individual market to use tax-free savings in a Health Savings Account (HSA) to pay their health care premiums. Johnson sees this bill as a chance for individual policy purchasers to be able to use tax-free dollars to buy health care, just as employees are able to do through payroll deductions.</p>

<p align="justify">Another aspect of the bill would allow a person with an individual policy who is then hired by an employer who provides health coverage to receive employer-paid contributions to his or her HSA rather than the employer adding the new employee to the group health plan. It remains to be seen whether the bill will attract much interest in the House.</p>

<p><strong>Percentage Of Uninsured Americans Drops</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), released a report at the end of June stating that the percentage of Americans without insurance has dropped from 15.4% in 1997 to 14.2% in 2005. A larger decrease was noted in the percentage of children without insurance, which dropped from 13.9% in 1997 to 8.9% last year. The NCHS reports that insurance coverage rates vary widely from state to state, with 6% uninsured in Massachusetts, compared to over 24% in Texas.</p>

<p><strong>Relating With Embezzlers Is A Fiduciary Breach, Says Court</strong></p>

<p align="justify">In late June the 2<sup>nd</sup> US Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of a lower court that a health fund administrator was indeed in breach of her fiduciary duties when she maintained a relationship between the fund and an individual she knew to have previously embezzled $475,517. The administrator, Sandra Briand, knew of the embezzlement because the previous administrator had been her husband, and he had entered into an agreement with the embezzler, Clarke Lasky, to repay the fund. However, Briand failed to sever the relationship until he had embezzled an additional $177,271.</p>

<p align="justify">The higher court stated that a fiduciary who breaches his or her responsibilities should be held personally liable, and upheld the district court’s assessment that she owes the health fund the $177,271 which was embezzled on her watch.</p>

<p><strong>Return From Lunch Injury Not Subject To Going And Coming Rule</strong></p>

<p align="justify">In mid&ndash;June the Maine Supreme Judicial Court ruled that a worker who hurt herself while returning to work from lunch is entitled to worker’s compensation benefits. In appealing a previous decision by a Worker’s Compensation Board, Aetna argued that the injury should be subject to the going and coming rule, an established exception for accidents which occur off-premises while the employee is on the way to or from work. The court stated, however, that since the accident occurred on the stairs within the Aetna building, the location could be considered part of Aetna’s premises. In addition, the court stated that the activity during which the accident occurred was “an insubstantial deviation from her employment” and was not reckless, therefore she should receive benefits.</p>

<p align="justify">This decision seems to differ from a recent ruling by the 7<sup>th</sup> Circuit Court of Appeals, which denied benefits to an employee who fell in the restroom, because going to the restroom is not among the employee’s job responsibilities.</p>
