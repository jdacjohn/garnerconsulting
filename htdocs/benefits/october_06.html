<strong>FASB Issues New Accounting Requirements For OPEB</strong>

<p align="justify">On September 29, 2006, the Federal Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. The new standard requires employers to note the over- or underfunded benefit obligation as an asset or liability on their balance sheets. The balance sheet adjustment must be recorded annually, and should be recorded as comprehensive income for businesses, and changes in net assets for non-profits.</p>

<p align="justify">The change is effective for fiscal years after December 15, 2006 for public companies, and six months later for private companies.</p>  

<p><strong>House Committee Approves Sweeter HSA Honeypot</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On September 27, 2006 the House Ways and Means Committee approved a bill that would allow both employers and employees to contribute more to health savings accounts (HSAs) than the current limits. Rather than the current limits of $2,700 or the amount of the high deductible health plan (HDHP) deductible for single coverage, $5,450 or the deductible for family coverage, the bill would allow contributions up to $2,700 or $5,400, regardless of deductible.</p>  

<p align="justify">The bill would also allow employers or employees to contribute up to the limit regardless of when in the year the employee enrolls in the HDHP. This would replace the current prorating of maximums for mid-year enrollments.</p>  

<p align="justify">Additionally, the bill would allow a one-time rollover of unused flexible spending account (FSA) or health reimbursement account (HRA) balances into an HSA. This opportunity must be used by the end of 2011. Finally, the bill would allow the same rollover from an IRA, allowing people to withdraw funds tax-free from an IRA to pay for health expenses.</p>  

<p><strong>Michigan Removes Barriers To Wellness Program Incentives</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On October 3, 2006, Michigan governor, Jennifer Granholm, signed a bill that allows insurers and health maintenance organizations to offer wellness programs with incentives for healthy behavior. Rebates, lower premiums or reduced copayments of up to 10% are now allowed by Michigan law. Michigan law already allows property and casualty insurers to give rate reductions in exchange for positive behaviors such as using an alarm system.</p>  

<p align="justify">As the bill was being considered, the Michigan surgeon general told legislators that unhealthy lifestyle choices cost the state about $8.9 billion in health care costs per year. Obesity-related conditions alone cost about $2.9 billion. Republican state Senator Tom George has stated that Michigan residents have more unhealthy behaviors than residents of other states, and he looks to the legislation to create incentives for people to change their behavior.</p>  

<p align="justify">The bill takes effect in January 2007.</p>  
 
<p><strong>Morbid Obesity Is Not Usually ADA Protected, Rules Court</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The 6<sup>th</sup> US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on September 28, 2006, that the morbidly obese are not protected by ADA unless their weight problem stems from another, underlying condition. Upholding a previous ruling, the court said that the ADA is not meant to protect those who are just different on a physical level, like those who are extremely tall or extremely short.</p>  

<p align="justify">In the case, involving a driver and freight loader who suffered a work-related knee injury, Judge Stephen Grindle made the sad comment that, at 400 pounds, the driver was not even abnormally obese. And since the conditions were not caused by an underlying physiological condition, he said, interpreting them as ADA impairments would open floodgates to anyone who has an atypical physique to claim ADA protection.</p> 

<p><strong>DOL Launches Health Benefits Advisor Web Site</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On October 5, 2006, the Department of Labor (DOL) launched a website intended to make it easier for plan sponsors to ensure that they are in compliance with COBRA, HIPAA, the Newborn’s and Mother’s Health Protection Act, the Mental Health Parity Act, and the Women’s Health and Cancer Rights Act. Users of the site are presented with tools and facts about health benefit laws. The site is part of the DOL’s larger compliance assistance program.</p>  

<p><strong>Court Cites TPA For Insufficient Evidence Of COBRA Notification</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The 8<sup>th</sup> US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in August that a health care administrator failed to prove that it had made a good faith effort to provide a COBRA notice to a terminated employee. The employee sued the TPA, saying that she did not receive the notice and therefore lost out on benefits. The appeals court overturned a previous decision in favor of the administrator, saying that the administrator had proven that they had a system for generating and mailing letters, but not that the system was followed. An audit report was the only evidence submitted to prove that letters were actually mailed, and the court ruled that the report was not sufficient evidence.</p> 
 
<p><strong>Cafeteria Plan Contributions Need Not Be Held In Trust, Says Court</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The 4<sup>th</sup> US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in mid-August that a company is not required under ERISA to keep employee contributions separate from other company funds. Noting that it is the company’s fiduciary duty to ensure that contributions are not used for other purposes, the court ruled that in this case, in which all contributions were made within 90 days, there was no fiduciary breach.</p>  

<p align="justify">The employees who filed suit against the company when it dropped the plan in 2000, said that the company had breached fiduciary duty by not properly funding the plan. According to the court, the company had indeed underfunded the self-funded plan, but this was not part of the court’s consideration. The court ruled that the uncontested evidence showing that the company had not siphoned off employee contributions for company purposes, was sufficient to exonerate it.</p>
