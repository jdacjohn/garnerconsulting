<b>IRS Announces Changes</b>

<p align="justify">The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced various annual changes to tax credits and limits affecting benefits, which include the following:

<ul type="square">
<li>Mileage rate changes include: $0.12 a mile for moving and medical (down from $0.13 in 2002), $0.14 for charity (no change from 2002), $0.36 for business (down from $0.365 in 2002);</li>

<li>The monthly parking limit has been raised from $185 to $190, while mass transit and carpooling has stayed at $100 a month (clarification has been issued from the IRS that in areas where free passes are available for mass transit, employers may not reimburse employees);</li>

<li>The per diem limit for tax-free long-term care benefits has been raised to $220 per day;</li>

<li>Single coverage deductibles for Archer MSAs can be $1,700 - $2,500 (out-of-pocket costs to be no more than $3,350) and family coverage deductibles for Archer MSAs will be $3,350 to $5,050 (out-of-pocket costs to be no more than $6,150);</li>

<li>The adoption tax credit is $10,160 (phasing out beginning at gross income of $152,390 and completely phased out at income of $192,390).</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Oregon Voters Reject Single-Payer Initiative</b>

<p align="justify">By a 4 - 1 margin, Oregon voters defeated Measure 23, which would have created a statewide health plan similar to former President Clinton’s efforts almost a decade ago. Measure 23, the Oregon Comprehensive Health Care Finance Act of 2002, would have raised income taxes by as much as 17%. The plan, which was estimated to cost $20 billion a year, would have more than doubled the entire current state budget of $16 billion a year.

<p><b>Shift In Senate Could Mean Health Care Reform Changes</b>

<p align="justify">The Republican takeover of the Senate could mean significant public policy changes, among them issues such as prescription drug coverage for seniors. Earlier in the year, the House passed a prescription drug plan that would have put the private sector in charge, rather than Medicare. The House version is now more likely to be passed by the Senate. Similarly, other bills passed by the House, but not the Senate may now become law. These include association health plans and patients’ rights legislation with limits on damages.

<p align="justify">In 2001, both the House and Senate passed versions of patients’ rights legislation. There were a number of provisions that were basically the same in each bill, including:

<ul type="square">

<li>If a plan does not have a specialist who is available or appropriate to treat a patient, the plan must provide access to a non-network specialist at no extra cost to the patient.</li>

<li>Patients could go to the closest emergency room at the same cost as a preferred facility if a prudent layperson would determine that emergency care was needed.</li>

<li>Plans would be required to allow the substitution of a nonformulary prescription drug at the cost of a formulary drug, if the treating physician deems the alternative drug medically necessary.</li>

<li>Plans would have to provide patients the right to coverage of routine costs in clinical trials funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, the Veterans Administration or the Food and Drug Administration.</li>

</ul>

<p align="justify">Any legislation passed by a Republican-controlled Congress is likely to include these provisions, on which consensus was reached some time ago.

<p><b>ERISA Compliance</b>

<p align="justify">In order to ensure benefit plans’ compliance with the Form 5500 annual filing requirements, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (PWBA, a division of the Department of Labor) have established a joint project designed to detect potential nonfilers. Those identified as such will receive letters of inquiry from the IRS and PWBA, starting next month. Penalties for lack of compliance with ERISA’s filing requirements can be up to $1,100 per day per report that has not been filed; additionally, the IRS may impose fines of $25 per day (up to $15,000). While announcing this new plan to find nonfilers, both groups reiterated that those who have not filed may be eligible for the Delinquent Filer Voluntary Compliance (DFVC) program, in which they would pay lower fines for late reports.

<p><b>House Approves Mental Health Parity Extension</b>

<p align="justify">The House of Representatives passed HR 5716, which would extend the Mental Health Parity Law until December 31, 2003. Previously set to expire in September 2001, President Bush signed an appropriations bill in January 2002 extending the law until December 31, 2002.
