<b>HHS Publishes Final Security Regulations Under HIPAA</b>

<p align="justify">On February 20, 2003, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published final security regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Technically, covered entities have until April 21, 2005 to come into compliance with these new rules, unless Congress takes action to overturn or delay them, which is unlikely. Small health plans (less than $5 million a year in premiums for insured plans or claims for self-funded plans) have until April 21, 2006 to come into compliance. Practically speaking, plans should be close to compliance by April 14, 2003 (2004 for small health plans), when the privacy regulations require covered entities to safeguard protected health information (PHI). The final security regulations provide the best interpretation as to how to safeguard PHI.

<p align="justify">The final security regulations adopt standards for the security of electronic PHI that must be implemented by covered entities. Covered entities are health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers.

<p align="justify">In 1998, HHS published proposed security regulations that also proposed a standard for electronic signatures. The final security regulations do not address electronic signatures, but HHS has said a final rule for electronic signatures will be published later.

<p align="justify">The security and privacy regulations are inextricably linked. The protection of the privacy of information depends in large part on the existence of security measures to protect that information. The final security regulations conform to many aspects of the final privacy regulations, but it is important to note several distinct differences between the privacy regulations and the security regulations.

<p align="justify">The security regulations define administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI. The security regulations require covered entities to implement basic safeguards to protect electronic PHI from unauthorized access, alteration, deletion and transmission. The privacy regulations, by contrast, set standards for how PHI should be controlled by setting forth what uses and disclosures are authorized or required and what rights patients have with respect to their health information.

<p align="justify">The final security regulations narrow the scope of the information to which the safeguards must be applied to PHI in electronic form. Thus the scope of information covered by the security regulations is more limited than that of the privacy regulations, which apply to PHI in any form.

<p align="justify">HHS restructured the final security regulations to permit greater flexibility. While all standards must be met, HHS now only requires 13 implementation specifications. The remainder of the implementation specifications are “addressable”. For addressable specifications, a covered entity must decide whether each specification is a reasonable and appropriate security measure to apply within its particular security framework. This decision should be based on a variety of factors, such as, among others, the entity’s risk analysis, risk mitigation strategy, the security measures already in place and the cost of implementation. Based upon this decision, the following apply:

<ul type="square">
<li>If a given addressable implementation specification is determined to be reasonable and appropriate, the covered entity must implement it.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>If a given addressable implementation specification is determined to be an inappropriate and/or unreasonable security measure for the covered entity, but the standard cannot be met without implementation of an additional security safeguard, the covered entity may implement an alternate measure that accomplishes the same end as the addressable implementation specification. An entity that meets a given standard through alternative measures must document the decision not to implement the addressable implementation specification, the rationale behind that decision and the alternative safeguard implemented to meet the standard.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>A covered entity may also decide that a given implementation specification is simply not applicable (that is, neither reasonable nor appropriate) to its situation and that the standard can be met without implementation of an alternative measure in place of the addressable implementation specification.  In this scenario, the covered entity must document the decision not to implement the addressable specification, the rationale behind the decision and how the standard is being met.</li></ul>

<p align="justify">The final security regulations require covered entities to implement policies and procedures that are reasonably designed, taking into account the size and type of activities of the covered entity that relate to electronic PHI and require that the policies and procedures be documented in written form.
