<b>IRS Explains Health Coverage Tax Credit</b>

<p align="justify">On July 29, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released an explanation of a new program that can pay nearly two-thirds of eligible individuals’ health plan premiums. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) was created by the Trade Act of 2002.

<p align="justify">The HCTC pays 65% of the cost of premiums for qualified health plans for eligible individuals and qualified family members. It is not a Federal government insurance program. Insurers selected by each state (or via automatic options through COBRA, spousal or individual coverage) provide the insurance. Recipients can receive their benefits either in advance to help pay health plan premiums as they come due, or in a lump sum when they file their federal tax returns. The advance tax credit program became operational August 1, 2003, although the year-end tax credit has been available since December 2002.

<p align="justify">Certain types of health plans automatically qualify for the HCTC program:

<ul type="square">
<li>COBRA continuation coverage, unless the employer/former employer pays at least 50% of the cost of coverage;</li>

<li>Spousal coverage if the employer pays less than 50% of the cost of coverage (reminder—the IRS considers pre-tax contributions to be employer contributions); and</li>

<li>Individual coverage in which the HCTC candidate was enrolled at least 30 days prior to separation from the job that made him or her eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance Act benefits, Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits or payments from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">Health plans will continue to deal with COBRA continuees as they have in the past, but payments may come from the HCTC program, rather than the continuee. Continuees who choose the advance tax credit option will pay their 35% of the premium to the HCTC program, which will submit full payment to the health plan. Health plans will need to provide necessary information to the HCTC program and will need to register to receive payments.

<p align="justify">To receive payment from the HCTC program, health plan administrators must be registered by the Department of the Treasury as a vendor. Registration can be completed online at <a href="http://www.ccr.gov" target="_blank">www.ccr.gov</a>. The Central Contractor Registration website has a handbook that can be viewed prior to registration.

<p><b>HHS Issues Guidance On HIPAA EDI Rule</b>

<p align="justify">On July 24, 2003, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a guidance document on compliance with the electronic data interchange (EDI) rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). In response to speculation that the deadline for compliance might be extended again, the guidance states: “The law is clear: October 16, 2003 is the deadline for covered entities to comply with HIPAA’s electronic transaction and code sets provisions. After that date, covered entities, including health plans, may not conduct noncompliant transactions.”

<p align="justify">The guidance does state HHS will consider good faith efforts to comply when assessing individual complaints. The guidance indicates that HHS may choose not to impose a civil money penalty where a failure to comply is based on reasonable cause and is not due to willful neglect and the failure to comply is cured within 30 days.

<p align="justify">The guidance concludes with the following statement:

<blockquote><p align="justify">In the few remaining months before the October 16<sup>th</sup> deadline, HHS encourages health plans and providers to intensify their efforts toward achieving transaction and code set compliance. In addition, HHS encourages health plans to assess the readiness of their provider communities to determine the need to implement contingency plans to maintain the flow of payments while continuing to work toward compliance. Although transaction and code set compliance is a huge undertaking, the result will be greatly enhanced electronic communication throughout the health care community. Successful implementation will require the attention and cooperation of all health plans and clearinghouses, and of all providers that conduct electronic transactions. There is considerable industry support for transaction and code sets, and we all look forward to realizing the many advantages of its successful implementation.</blockquote>

<b>California's Recall Race May Lead To Play-Or-Pay Plan</b>

<p align="justify">California’s Democratic-controlled legislature is rushing to get a health insurance bill to Governor Davis before the recall election on October 7, 2003. If the Governor is recalled and replaced with a Republican, chances for a bill that is to the liking of the legislature being signed will decline significantly. There is a good chance that the legislature will pass Senate President Pro Tem John Burton’s bill, SB2. The bill is in a conference committee and subject to change, but indications are that employers with 20 or more employees will be required to pay 80% of health insurance costs or pay into a state fund that would provide coverage.

<p align="justify">Supporters estimate that 1.2 million people (more than half of California’s uninsured who work) would get health insurance under the plan. Burton’s plan is supported by the California Labor Federation and the California Medical Association and opposed by most business groups because of the high cost.
