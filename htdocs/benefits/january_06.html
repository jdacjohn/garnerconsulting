<b>CMS Releases Guidance On Creditable Coverage Disclosure Notices</b>

<p align="justify">On January 10, 2006, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) released additional guidance on the Disclosure Notice of Creditable Coverage for prescription plans which currently cover Medicare Part D-eligible individuals. This Notice is due for most entities on March 31, 2006. Along with governmental and military plans, the following entities must provide this Disclosure Notice: 

<ul type="square">
<li>Group Health Plans, including Government Plans</li>
<li>Union/Taft-Hartley Plans</li>
<li>Church and Other Group-sponsored Plans</li>
<li>Individual Health Insurers, including Medigap Plans</li></ul>

<p align="justify">The Notice, which includes an actuarial test which is the same as the "gross test" for application for the Part D subsidy, is due on March 31, 2006 for plan years that end in 2006.  For plan years ending in 2007 and beyond, the Notice is due within 60 days after the beginning date of the plan year.  The Notice is also due within 30 days of either termination or change in creditable coverage for any prescription drug plan.  

<p>The form, instructions and further guidance can be found at <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/creditablecoverage" target="_blank">http://www.cms.hhs.gov/creditablecoverage</a>.  

<p><b>Controversy Continues Over Maryland's Fair Share Bill</b>

<p align="justify">On January 12, both houses of the Maryland legislature voted to overturn the governor's veto of a new law which has been nicknamed the Wal-Mart Bill. The Act earned this nickname because Wal-Mart is the only employer in the state that would not be in compliance with the law. The Act requires all employers with more than 10,000 employees to spend at least eight percent of their payroll toward health care. It was vetoed by Maryland's governor, Robert Ehrlich, Jr., in May of last year.  

<p align="justify">In an announcement timed to influence the legislature's voting to overturn the veto, the Maryland Chamber of Commerce told the press that the state's Fair Share Health Care Act is preempted by a provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). ERISA prevents states from mandating the provision of a certain level of benefits by employers, the Chamber said. The Baltimore lawyer who wrote the Chamber's opinion stated that this is precisely the kind of law that ERISA is meant to prevent.  

<p align="justify">Meanwhile, the AFL-CIO is trying to influence Pennsylvania and 29 other states to pass similar bills, with the size of employers and the required percentage varying by state. The union's president states that "Big companies like Wal-Mart are pulling [our health care system] apart and profiting at taxpayer's expense." An initiative in Massachusetts aims even higher-the state's House passed a "play or pay" law last Fall, which would require employers with more than 10 employees to insure employees or pay into a statewide fund for the uninsured. Though the Massachusetts state Senate is still resisting the bill in a conference committee, the proponents may place the measure on the ballot as an initiative in the fall.  

<p><b>Two AD&amp;D Cases Address Drunk Driving</b>

<p align="justify">In December, two US District Courts heard cases involving accidental death and dismemberment claims and drunk driving. In the Southern District of West Virginia the court ruled that an employer was not right in asserting that a plan participant should have foreseen the likelihood of dying when he got behind the wheel while intoxicated. "The fact that negligence or a decision that makes an accident more likely to occur exists does not mean that once the accident occurs, that it was not really an accident," said Judge Joseph Goodwin in his decision in favor of the widow, who had sued the plan administrator for $86,000 in denied benefits.  

<p align="justify">In another case in the Southern District of New York, a plan participant was denied benefits for losing his eyesight in an accident caused by his intoxication. Judge Colleen McMahon found that it was a reasonable conclusion by the plan that the accident could have been avoided if the driver were sober. The accident, which occurred on an all-terrain vehicle, took place when the plaintiff had a blood-alcohol reading of .127. Though the plaintiff did not deny drinking at the time of the accident, he maintains that he was not intoxicated.  

<p><b>Texas Judge Rules That SPD Must Be Unambiguous</b>

<p align="justify">A Texas federal judge found that a long term disability insurer's disclaimer in its Summary Plan Description (SPD) that in case of any discrepancy between the SPD and plan documents, plan documents would govern, is illegal. The court stated that if a participant has to read the plan documents as well as the SPD, the summary is useless. In this case, the court found that the SPD required more effort than a person of average intelligence and experience could be expected to make in order to understand plan provisions and was therefore ambiguous. This created a situation in which the participant must also read the plan document and therefore the insurer was in violation of the ERISA requirement that an SPD be provided.  

<p><b>Well-Being Index Released For 2005</b>

<p align="justify">The Principal Financial Group released its Well-Being index in December and again, employees rank health insurance as the most valued employee benefit. As in 2004, 90% of respondents felt this way, with defined contribution plans running a distant second at 71%. The most-frequently offered benefit by companies with between ten and 1,000 employees is health insurance, followed by life insurance, defined contribution retirement plans, free parking and disability insurance. There was a significant drop in defined contribution and disability insurance offerings-a reduction of 6% and 5%, respectively.  

<p align="justify">The number of respondents who said that good benefits motivate them to work harder has dropped from 70% in 2004 to 65% in 2005. The number of employees who feel that their employer is concerned about their long-term financial health has also dropped eight percent to 25% in 2005.  

<p><b>IRS Releases Amended Mileage Amounts</b>

<p align="justify">Effective January 1, 2006, the IRS allowable rates for mileage will be reduced four cents from the post-Katrina high of 48.5 cents per mile. Although being reduced, this new rate of 44.5 cents per mile is significantly higher than the rate for the first 8 months of 2005. The IRS moving mileage rate is 18 cents per mile, also as of January 1.  

<p><b>Sponsors Save Big Through Medicare Part D</b>

<p align="justify">A study of the Society of Actuaries, released this month, shows that pharmacy plan sponsors for Medicare-eligible retirees may save over 80% through the new Medicare Part D options available to them. The most savings are to be found through dropping any current prescription coverage in favor of paying retirees' Part D premiums. Sponsors who integrate their plans with Part D or create 'wrap-around' plans can save from 31% to 49%, while sponsors who choose to take the Medicare Part D subsidy save 28% of costs between $250 and $5,000 per person.  

<p align="justify">The study forecasts that savings will decrease over time for most sponsors, except for those who choose to drop their current plans and pay retirees' premiums instead. Kevin Dolsky, a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries, stated that the program will have the most significant impact on large groups with large numbers of Medicare-eligible retirees: schools, state and local governments and older manufacturing companies.
