<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1">

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">The following is a brief summary of some of the new laws affecting life, health and disability insurance in California. Unless otherwise noted, the bills described here apply to contracts issued, amended, delivered or renewed on or after January 1, 2007.</p>

<p><b><i>Influenza Vaccinations</i></b></p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">AB 699 is intended to facilitate the sharing of vaccine supplies between providers within a localized area. The law requires distributors to provide a report to the State Department of Health Services regarding shipments of vaccine to providers. Some nonprofit health service plans must also provide these reports. Health care providers themselves, with the exception of some practices which conduct flu shot campaigns on the behalf of a corporation, do not have to provide the reports.</p>

<p><b><i>Hospital Fair Pricing Policies</i></b></p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">AB 774 addresses the rates that hospitals charge patients who must pay their own medical bills. These self-pay rates are often quite a bit higher than the rates paid on behalf of insured patients. In his signing message, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger stated that “the bill will provide relief to families and individuals by ensuring patients receive information about public health insurance, charity care and discount programs, have access to significant discounts, and are given a reasonable time to begin paying their hospital bill.” The bill requires that hospitals maintain an understandable written policy regarding discounts for financially qualified patients, as well as charity care possibilities.</p>

<p><b><i>Child Care Income Tax Credit</i></b></p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">AB 1282 extends the employer Child Care Program Credit and the Employer Child Care Contribution Credit to tax years beginning before January 1, 2012. These credits exist for startup expenses of a program, construction expenses for a facility, information and referral services, and contributions to a qualified care plan.</p>

<p><b><i>Health Records of Minors</i></b></p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">AB 1994 expands on existing law under which health care providers are allowed discretion in giving a representative of a minor access to that minor’s medical records. The providers are allowed to refuse access if they deem that such access will disrupt their professional relationship with the patient. Providers are exempted from liability resulting from a decision not to allow access. AB 1994 clarifies that providers are also exempted from liability resulting from a decision not to provide copies of a patient’s records to that minor patient’s representative.</p>

<p><b><i>Confidentiality of Medical Records</i></b></p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">SB 1307 expands upon existing law which allows representatives of a patient to access that patient’s medical records. The law clarifies who may act as a patient’s agent, including an agent acting under a power of attorney for health care. The law allows for disclosure to the extent necessary for the agent to fulfill his or her duties. In addition, the bill allows for the agent to make certain decisions after the death of a patient, and, if necessary, to consult with a supervising health care provider.</p>

<p><b><i>Employment Practices</i></b></p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">AB 2095 is a two-part bill. The first part addresses harassment of employees, clarifying that harassment by the employer or with the employer’s knowledge is against the law. It also requires employers with 50 or more employees to provide at least 2 hours of training to all supervisors employed as of January 1, 2005, unless such training has been provided since January 1, 2003. Training must be provided to all supervisors every 2 years and to new supervisory trainees within 6 months of their promotion to supervisory duties.</p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">The second part of the bill regards wages. All wages earned are payable twice a month, with some exceptions. If wages are paid within 7 calendar days of the close of the pay period, and overtime wages are paid no later than the payday for the next regular pay period, employers are considered in compliance with the law.</p>

<p><b><i>Benefit Ramifications of Military Service</i></b></p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">AB 2884 provides for administrative penalties for health care entities which do not reinstate coverage for a United States National Guard Military Reserve member without exclusions or waiting periods. Existing law provided for penalties to be levied against insurers, and this law extends that jurisdiction to health care service plans and specialized healthcare service plans. In addition, the law states that any person or entity subject to regulation under HMO laws will be disciplined by the Department of Managed Health Care.</p>

<p><b><i>Individual Health Care Coverage</i></b></p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">AB 2889 requires HMOs and insurers to permit individuals who have been covered under an individual plan for at least 18 months to transfer to another individual plan or policy with equal or lesser benefits. The transfer must be allowed at least once per year, and without medical underwriting. HMOs and insurers will be required to rank their products to facilitate this.</p>
