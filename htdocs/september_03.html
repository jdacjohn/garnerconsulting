<b>IRS Allows OTC Drug Reimbursement</b>

<p align="justify">On September 3, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service issued Revenue Ruling 2003-102, which overturns a prior ruling regarding reimbursement for over-the-counter (OTC) drugs under health plans. Because this ruling is a clarification of the IRS’ interpretation of existing law, there is no effective date. That means that OTC drugs can be reimbursed under any plan that would allow such reimbursement retroactively for as far into the past as a plan allows. For example, if a plan allows reimbursement for any expenses for medical care, as defined in Internal Revenue Code section 213(d), the plan now covers OTC drugs. If a plan allows reimbursement at any time up until March 31 of the year following the date the expense was incurred, a claimant could submit OTC claims for any expenses incurred January 1, 2003 or later. The claim substantiation rules apply to all claims, including claims for OTC drugs.

<p align="justify">The Revenue Ruling allows reimbursements “by an employer of amounts paid by an employee for medicines and drugs purchased by the employee without a physician’s prescription”. The Revenue Ruling goes on to say “amounts paid by an employee for dietary supplements that are merely beneficial to the general health of the employee or the employee’s spouse or dependents, are not reimbursable”.

<p align="justify">This ruling will have the greatest impact on health care flexible spending accounts (FSAs) and health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs), which often base the definition of eligible expenses on IRC section 213(d). The ruling does apply to any health plan, which means PPOs, HMOs and other plans could be redefined to cover OTC drugs, particularly drugs like Claritin that recently required a prescription.

<p align="justify">This change will make administration of health plans more challenging, since the requirement of a prescription made for an easy-to-administer test, but the change will allow plans to be more creative in attempting to control costs.

<p><b>Effective Date Of COBRA Regulations To Be Delayed</b>

<p align="justify">On September 17, 2003, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) announced that they will provide adequate time for group health plans to comply with final rules on the notice requirements of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). In proposed regulations issued earlier this year, EBSA indicated compliance would be required by January 1, 2004. EBSA now says that group health plans will have six months to come into compliance with the final rules after they are issued. EBSA had previously indicated the final rules would be issued in 2003, but now says they are expected in early 2004.

<p><b>California Legislature Approves Play-Or-Pay Bill</b>

<p align="justify">On September 13, 2003, the California legislature sent SB 2 to the Governor for his signature or veto. This bill would create a State Health Purchasing Program. This bill would require employers to provide health benefits (play) or pay a fee to the Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board (MRMIB), which would provide health benefits.
 
<p align="justify">If the Governor signs the bill, large employers (200 or more employees) will be required to pay 80% of both employee and dependent premiums beginning January 1, 2006. Employers with 50 through 199 employees will be required to pay 80% of employee premiums beginning January 1, 2007. Employers with 20 through 49 employees will not be required to pay or play until the legislature approves a subsidy. Employers with less than 20 employees are exempt.

<p align="justify">In order to be eligible, an employee must work at least 100 hours per month for at least three months. Sole proprietors and partners are included in the definition of an eligible employee if they work enough hours.

<p align="justify">Employees without family coverage who earn less than 200% of the federal poverty guidelines for an individual cannot be required to contribute more than 5% of their wages. Employees of large employers with family coverage who earn less than 200% of the federal poverty guidelines for a family of three, cannot be required to contribute more than 5% of their wages.

<p align="justify">The bill requires MRMIB to determine the level of benefits that must be provided and the fee to be paid in lieu of providing benefits.

<p align="justify">The definition of a dependent includes same-sex domestic partners and opposite-sex domestic partners if one of the partners is at least age 62.

<p align="justify">In determining the size of an employer, the IRS definition of a controlled group of corporations is used, with certain exceptions. The bill makes it illegal for an employer to designate an employee as an independent contractor or temporary employee, reduce an employee’s hours of work or terminate and rehire an employee if the purpose is to avoid the employer’s obligations to provide health benefits or pay the fee.

<p align="justify">Most of California’s rules governing small groups (2 to 50 employees) will be extended to groups up to 199 employees, with some variations in rules.

<p align="justify">If an employer chooses to purchase more than one health plan, the employer may require a higher level of contribution as long as one plan meets the contribution standards.

<p align="justify">SB 2 will not become effective unless AB 1528 is also enacted. AB 1528 would create a commission to investigate health policy issues, including cost containment and make recommendations to the legislature and governor. If the Governor signs the bill, as expected, at least two legal challenges to SB 2 can be expected. One key challenge will be based on the argument that ERISA preempts a state play-or-pay mandate. Because the legislature did not pass SB 2 with a two-thirds vote, which is required for new taxes, opponents of SB 2 will argue that the fee required under SB 2 is a tax and the law is therefore not operative.
