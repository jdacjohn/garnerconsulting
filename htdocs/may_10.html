<strong>DETAILS ON DEPENDENT COVERAGE TO AGE 26 UNDER REFORM</strong>

	<p>On Monday, May 10, 2010, the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) of the
	Department of Labor, along with the Departments of the Treasury and Health and Human Services
	released Interim Final Rules (available at <a href="" target="_blank">http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/dependentcoverage.pdf</a>)
	implementing the extension of dependent coverage for children up to age 26 as part of the
	requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (referred to as The Affordable
	Care Act). The EBSA also released a Fact Sheet and FAQs describing the extension of dependent
	coverage(available at <a href="" target="_blank">http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/newsroom/fsdependentcoverage.html</a>) and
	(<a href="" target="_blank">http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-dependentcoverage.html</a>, respectively).</p>

	<p>Under the Act, all plans and insurance issuers that offer dependent coverage must offer coverage to an
	enrollee's adult children whether married or unmarried until the child reaches age 26, even if the adult
	child no longer lives with the parents, is not a dependent on a parent's tax return or is no longer a
	student. (Plans that do not provide dependent coverage are not required to do so under the Act.)
	However, this extended eligibility does not apply to the adult child's spouse or children. This
	expansion of eligibility is effective for plan or policy years beginning on or after September 23, 2010.
	Calendar year plans will have to comply as of January 1, 2011. Under a transition rule, if the adult
	child has another offer of employer-based coverage other than a parent's coverage, plans would
	generally not have to provide extended dependent coverage to that child until 2014.</p>

	<p>For plan or policy years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, plans and issuers are required to
	give adult children who qualify a special enrollment opportunity that continues for at least 30 days
	even if the plan offers a periodic open enrollment period. Plans and issuers must provide a written
	notice of this special enrollment opportunity no later than the first day of the first plan or policy year
	beginning on or after September 23, 2010. The rules provide that any qualified adult child must be
	offered all of the benefit packages on the same terms as are available to similarly-situated individuals
	who did not lose coverage due to a cessation of student status.</p>

	<p>HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has asked leading insurance companies to begin covering adult
	dependent children voluntarily before the Act's implementation date. Over 65 companies have
	agreed to cover adult dependent children who graduate from school or age off of their parent's
	coverage before the Act's implementation date, including Aetna, Blue Shield of California, CIGNA,
	Kaiser and WellPoint (parent of Anthem).</p>

	<p>Regulations relating to grandfathered health plans are expected to be published in the very
	near future. The regulations released on May 10 included a statement that the Departments
	anticipate that the regulations on grandfathered plans will make clear that a plan will not lose
	its grandfathered status if it voluntarily complies with the age 26 rules before being required
	to do so.</p>

	<p><strong>SOME DETAILS ON REINSURANCE PROGRAM FOR EARLY RETIREE PLANS</strong></p>

	<p>On Wednesday, May 5, 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released an
	Interim Final Rule (available at <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ociio/regulations/gate.pdf">http://www.hhs.gov/ociio/regulations/gate.pdf</a>) implementing the
	Early Retiree Reinsurance Program established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
	(referred to as The Affordable Care Act).</p>

	<p>This program will reimburse participating employer-based plans for a portion of the cost of health
	benefits provided to early retirees age 55 and older who are not eligible for Medicare and their
	spouses and to surviving spouses and their dependents. Both self-funded and insured plans can apply,
	including plans sponsored by private entities, state and local governments, nonprofits, religious
	entities, unions, and other employers.</p>

	<p>Initially the program will reimburse plans up to 80% of claim costs between $15,000 and $90,000
	with those amounts indexed for plan years beginning on or after October 1, 2011. Claims incurred
	between the start of the plan year (often January 1) and June 1st will be credited towards toward the
	$15,000 threshold for reimbursement. However, only medical expenses incurred after June 1, 2010
	are eligible for reimbursement under this Program.</p>

	<p>In order to participate, a sponsor's employer-based plan must be certified by the Secretary of HHS
	and must include programs and procedures that have generated or have the potential to generate costsavings
	with respect to plan participants with chronic and high-cost conditions. The Rule refers to a
	diabetes management program that includes aggressive monitoring and behavioral counseling to
	prevent complications and unnecessary hospitalization as a program that would qualify for
	certification under the Program.</p>

	<p>Sponsors wishing to participate in the Program must submit an application to HHS and will not be
	eligible for reimbursement under the Program until the application is approved. The application form
	is not yet available, but will be available by the end of June, 2010. Applications will be processed in
	the order received. Applicants must sign a sponsor agreement and comply with HIPAA privacy
	requirements in submitting their applications. Since funding is initially limited to $5 billion, plan
	sponsors should submit applications without undue delay, since HHS will likely stop accepting
	applications once total projected reimbursements reach the funding limit of $5 billion. Once
	approved, a plan's claims for reimbursement will also be paid in the order received.</p>

	<p><strong>NEW INTERPRETATION</strong></p>

	<p>Our April bulletin included the following statement: "Group health plans will now be required to
	provide employees with advance notice of material modifications at least 60 days before the effective
	date of the change. This new rule also applies to grandfathered plans and is effective for plan years
	beginning on and after September 23, 2010."We have now received an interpretation from our legal
	counsel that this provision will not apply until plan changes made on and after March 23, 2012.</p>
