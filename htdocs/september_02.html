<b>California Becomes First State With Paid Family Leave</b>

<p align="justify">On September 25, Governor Davis signed SB 1661, which makes California the first state in the nation with paid family leave. The new law provides benefits for any individual who is unable to work due to the employee’s own sickness or injury, the sickness or injury of a family member, or the birth, adoption or foster care placement of a child.

<p align="justify">This bill establishes a family temporary disability insurance program within the state disability insurance program (California is one of five states with a state disability insurance program), known as Family Temporary Disability Insurance (FTDI). The new law provides up to six weeks of wage replacement benefits to workers who take time off work to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, parent, domestic partner, or to bond with a new child. The bill provides the new benefits through additional employee contributions. The law authorizes employers to require that employees utilize up to two weeks of earned but unused vacation leave prior to that employee’s receipt of these new benefits. If a collective bargaining agreement requires something more generous, the terms of the collective bargaining agreement apply. All employers are covered under FTDI, regardless of their size and there is no requirement regarding how long a worker must have been employed before taking such leave. However, paid leave is not accessible if there is another family member who could provide the care.

<p align="justify">These benefits are payable for family temporary disability leaves that begin on or after July 1, 2004. The increased employee contributions to the state disability insurance fund will be effective January 1, 2004. The State calculates the amount of employee contributions necessary to fund disability benefits each year. The new benefits will be funded by an increase in the SDI tax of 0.08 percent of pay. The State estimates the average employee will pay $27 more per year to fund the new benefit. Employees on paid leave are to receive 55% of their wages, but no more than $728 a week.

<p align="justify">By January 1, 2004, the director of Employment Development will provide each covered employer with a notice informing workers of their new rights and benefits. Employers will need to provide the notice to all new employees hired on or after January 1, 2004 and to all employees leaving work on or after July 1, 2004 due to pregnancy, nonoccupational sickness or injury or the need to provide care for any sick or injured family member or new child who is unable to care for himself or herself.

<p align="justify">The law defines a family member to include a child, spouse, parent or domestic partner. Child is defined to include a biological, adopted or foster son or daughter, a stepson or stepdaughter, a legal ward, a son or daughter of a domestic partner or a son or daughter of an employee who stands in loco parentis to that child. Parent is defined to include a biological, foster or adoptive parent, a stepparent, a legal guardian or other person who stood in loco parentis to the employee when the employee was a child. Domestic partner is defined as persons of the same sex or persons of opposite sexes if one or both are over the age of 62. In order to qualify as a domestic partnership, the partners must file a declaration with the State.

<p><b>Association Health Plans</b>

<p align="justify">The Department of Labor has issued a report, “Association Health Plans: Improving Access to Affordable Quality Health Care for Small Businesses.” The DOL identifies barriers preventing small employers from offering health care coverage, including cost (which is higher per employee than for larger firms) and inability to negotiate effectively with carriers due to size. Furthermore, the report states that of the 39 million Americans without health insurance, employees of small businesses are disproportionately affected.

<p align="justify">The report asserts that AHPs will level the playing field by allowing small businesses to join together through trade and professional associations to purchase affordable health benefits. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that small employers obtaining insurance through an AHP will receive, on average, a 13% reduction in premiums. As a result of the decrease in price, estimates are that an additional 10,000 to 2 million Americans would acquire insurance.

<p align="justify">Key criteria for AHPs would include the following:

<ul type="square">

<li>Certification by the DOL, including meeting DOL-developed certification standards.</li>

<li>Coverage could be purchased from insurance companies, or if they cover enough participants, AHPs could self-fund.</li>

<li>Provisions to prevent AHPs from “cherry picking” the healthiest of workers.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Class Action Status Granted And Denied In Suits Against HMOs</b>

<p align="justify">Lawsuits filed against HMOs on behalf of plan members were denied class action status, while suits filed on behalf of doctors were granted class action status. In Miami, U.S. District Judge Federico A. Moreno ruled that health plan subscribers did not show a consistency among health plans, specifically because of the variance in contracts. However, in the suits filed by health care providers, he ruled that combining the suits into one trial would be appropriate. Physician lawsuits contend that HMOS methodically deny or postpone payments due to both the bundling and downgrading of claims. Further, Judge Moreno put the case, representing 600,000 doctors, on fast track to trial.
