<p><b>U.S. Supreme Court Limits Patients' Right To Sue HMOs</b>

<p align="justify">On June 21, 2004, in <i>Aetna Healthcare v. Davila</i> [No. 02-1845], the U. S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a Texas law allowing HMOs to be sued for malpractice is pre-empted by ERISA. In two consolidated cases, individuals sued their respective HMOs for alleged failures to exercise ordinary care in the handling of coverage decisions, in violation of a duty imposed by the Texas Health Care Liability Act (THCLA).

<p align="justify">Juan Davila and Ruby Calad are covered by ERISA-regulated employee benefit plans. The plan sponsors had entered into agreements with Aetna and CIGNA to administer the plans. Davila and Calad both suffered injuries allegedly arising from Aetna’s and CIGNA’s decisions not to provide coverage for certain treatment and services recommended by the treating physicians.

<p align="justify">Davila’s physician prescribed Vioxx for arthritis pain, but Aetna refused to pay for it. Davila did not appeal or contest the decision, nor did he purchase Vioxx and seek reimbursement. Instead, Davila began taking Naprosyn, from which he allegedly suffered a severe reaction that required extensive treatment and hospitalization.

<p align="justify">Calad underwent surgery and her treating physician recommended an extended hospital stay, but a CIGNA nurse determined that Calad did not meet the plan’s criteria for continued stay and denied coverage. Calad experienced postsurgical complications forcing her to return to the hospital. Calad alleged that these complications would not have occurred had CIGNA approved coverage for a longer hospital stay.

<p align="justify">Justice Thomas wrote that the “purpose of ERISA is to provide a uniform regulatory regime over employee benefit plans. To this end ERISA includes expansive pre-emption provisions...which are intended to ensure that employee benefit plan regulation would be exclusively a federal concern.” He went on to write: “Therefore, any state-law cause of action that duplicates, or supplants the ERISA civil enforcement remedy conflicts with the clear congressional intent to make the ERISA remedy exclusive and is therefore pre-empted.”

<p align="justify">Patient rights legislation has already been introduced in Congress that would overturn this decision. The issue may become important in the Presidential campaign. When George W. Bush was Governor of Texas, he allowed THCLA to become law without his signature. When he campaigned for the Presidency in 2000, he hailed THCLA as the kind of protection he wanted to give to all Americans. His administration argued to the Supreme Court that the THCLA should be overturned.

<p><b>IRS Issues More HSA Guidance</b>

<p align="justify">The Internal Revenue Service continues to issue guidance on the new Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). On June 1, 2004, the IRS published Internal Revenue Bulletin 2004-22, which included Revenue Ruling 2004-45 relating to HSAs.

<p align="justify">In order to be eligible for HSAs, people must be covered by a high deductible health plan (HDHP) and not have any other coverage. An eligible individual cannot be covered by a health plan that is not an HDHP unless that health plan provides permitted insurance or permitted coverage (disability, dental, vision, long-term care, accident-only, workers’ compensation or auto insurance) or preventive care. A health flexible spending account (FSA) and a health reimbursement arrangement (HRA) are health plans and constitute other coverage. Consequently, an individual who is covered by an HDHP and a health FSA or HRA is generally not an eligible individual for the purpose of making contributions to an HSA. 

<p align="justify">An individual is an eligible individual for the purpose of making contributions to an HSA for periods the individual is covered under the following arrangements:

<ul type="square">

<li><i>Limited-Purpose Health FSA or HRA.</i> A limited-purpose health FSA is an FSA that reimburses benefits for “permitted coverage”, as defined. A limited-purpose HRA is an HRA that reimburses benefits for “permitted insurance”, as defined or “permitted coverage” (but not for long-term care services). In addition, the limited-purpose health FSA or HRA may pay or reimburse preventive care benefits.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li><i>Suspended HRA.</i> A suspended HRA is an HRA that does not reimburse any medical expense incurred during the suspension period except preventive care, permitted insurance and permitted coverage (if otherwise allowed to be paid or reimbursed by the HRA). When the suspension period ends, the individual is no longer eligible for an HSA.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li><i>Post-Deductible Health FSA or HRA.</i> A post-deductible health FSA or HRA is one that does not reimburse any medical expense incurred before the minimum annual deductible is satisfied. Where the HDHP and the other coverage do not have identical deductibles, contributions to the HSA are limited to the lower of the deductibles.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li><i>Retirement HRA.</i> A retirement HRA is an HRA that reimburses only those medical expenses incurred after retirement. In this case, the individual is an eligible individual for the purpose of making contributions to the HSA before retirement but loses eligibility for coverage periods when the retirement HRA may pay medical expenses.</li>
</ul>
