	<strong>REGULATIONS RELEASED ON GRANDFATHERED STATUS UNDER REFORM</strong>

	<p>On Thursday, June 17, 2010, the Department of Labor (Employee Benefits Security Administration)
	(EBSA) along with the Departments of the Treasury (Internal Revenue Service) and Health and
	Human Services released much-anticipated regulations describing the changes a group health plan
	may or may not make in order to maintain its status as a grandfathered health plan under the
	provisions of The Affordable Care Act. These regulations may be found at
	<a href="http://www.dol.gov/federalregister/HtmlDisplay.aspx?DocId=23967&AgencyId=8&DocumentType=" target="_blank">http://www.dol.gov/federalregister/HtmlDisplay.aspx?DocId=23967&AgencyId=8&DocumentType=</a>
	2. The Departments also issued a Table of Provisions Applicable to Grandfathered Plans, available at
	<a href="http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/grandfatherregtable.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/grandfatherregtable.pdf</a> and model disclosure language required under
	the Act, available at <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/grandfatherregmodelnotice.doc" target="_blank">http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/grandfatherregmodelnotice.doc</a>. This followed the
	publication on June 15, 2010 of a Fact Sheet on "Keeping the Health Plan You Have: The Affordable
	Care Act" and "Grandfathered Health Plans" available at
	<a href="http://www.healthreform.gov/newsroom/keeping_the_health_plan_you_have.html" target="_blank">http://www.healthreform.gov/newsroom/keeping_the_health_plan_you_have.html</a> and FAQs
	available at <a href="http://www.healthreform.gov/about/grandfathering.html" target="_blank">http://www.healthreform.gov/about/grandfathering.html</a>.</p>

	<p>Under these new regulations, all health plans, whether or not they are grandfathered plans, will have
	to provide certain benefits beginning on or after September 23, 2010 including:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>No lifetime limits on coverage;</li>
	<li>No restrictions of coverage when people get sick and have previously made an unintentional
	mistake on their application;</li>
	<li>Extension of parents' coverage to young adults under age 26;</li>
	<li>No coverage exclusions for children with pre-existing conditions; and</li>
	<li>No "restricted" annual limits.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>Grandfathered health plans will be able to make routine changes to their policies and maintain their
	grandfathered status. The routine changes include cost adjustments to keep pace with medical
	inflation, adding new benefits, making modest adjustments to existing benefits, voluntarily adopting
	new consumer protections under the Affordable Care Act, or making changes to comply with State or
	other Federal laws. Premium changes will not affect a plan's grandfathered status.</p>

	<p>However, plans will lose their grandfathered status if they choose to make significant changes that
	reduce benefits or increase costs to members/consumers. Significant changes that will result in a plan
	losing its grandfathered status include:</p>

	<ul><li>Significantly cutting or reducing benefits;</li>
	<li>Increasing co-insurance charges under a plan;
	Significantly increasing co-payments by an amount which is the greater of $5 (adjusted
	annually for medical inflation) or by a percentage equal to medical inflation plus 15
	percentage points;</li>
	<li>Significantly raising deductibles by an amount which is greater than a percentage equal to
	medical inflation plus 15 percentage points;</li>
	<li>Significantly lowering employer contributions by more than 5%;</li>
	Adding or tightening an annual limit on what an insurer pays. (Note that under the new
	<li>regulations, plans that do not have an annual dollar limit cannot add such a limitation except
	under limited circumstances); and</li>
	<li>Changing insurance companies.</li></ul>

	<p>Under the new regulations, group health plans are required to disclose to members/consumers
	whenever it distributes materials whether the plan believes that it is a grandfathered plan and
	therefore not subject to some of the additional requirements under The Affordable Care Act.
	Additionally, if a grandfathered plan forces its members/consumers to switch to another
	grandfathered plan with lesser benefits or higher costs than the original plan, the plan will lose its
	grandfathered status. A plan will also lose its grandfathered status if it is bought by or merges with
	another plan simply to avoid complying with the Act.</p>

	<p>The federal government projects that large employer plans (100+ employees) will not see major
	changes to their plans as a result of these regulations. Most of these plans will retain their
	grandfathered status through 2011 based on the way they changed cost sharing arrangements in 2008-
	2009. Fully-insured plans that are subject to collective bargaining will be able to maintain their
	grandfathered status until the bargaining agreements expire. Retiree-only and "excepted health plans"
	such as dental plans, long term care insurance or Medigap plans are exempt from The Affordable
	Care Act's reforms. The federal government also projects that for small business plans (< 100
	employees) 70% of such plans will be grandfathered in the first year, but depending on plan design
	choices employers make, the government expects that only about 30% of small business plans will be
	able to retain their grandfathered status over the next several years. For individuals insured in the
	individual health insurance market, transition to plans that are compliant with the Act will be much
	faster, due to the rate with which such individuals switch plans in a typical year (on average, between
	40% to 65%).</p>

	<p><strong>WAGE & HOUR DIVISION INTERPRETS "IN LOCO PARENTIS" STATUS</strong></p>

	<p>On June 22, 2010, the Administrator of the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division
	published an Interpretation regarding the definition of a son or daughter under the Family and
	Medical Leave Act (FMLA) as it applies to an employee standing "in loco parentis" to a child.
	Examples of situations in which an in loco parentis relationship may be found include where a
	grandparent takes in a grandchild and assumes ongoing responsibility for raising the child because the
	parents are incapable of providing care, or where an aunt assumes responsibility for raising a child
	after the death of the child's parents. Such situations may, or may not, ultimately lead to a legal
	relationship with the child (adoption or legal ward), but no such relationship is required to find "in
	loco parentis" status. In contrast, an employee who cares for a child while the child's parents are on
	vacation would not be considered to be "in loco parentis" to the child.</p>
