	<p><b>RULES ISSUED UNDER THE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT</b></p>

	<p>On February 2, 2010 the Internal Revenue Service, Employee Benefits Security Administration and
	the Department of Health and Human Services issued interim final rules implementing the Mental
	Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA). The Act requires parity between
	mental health or substance use disorder benefits (previously known as substance abuse benefits) and
	medical/surgical benefits with respect to financial requirements and treatment limitations under group
	health plans and health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan. These rules will
	be effective April 5, 2010 and generally apply to group health plans and group health insurance
	issuers for plan years beginning on or after July 1, 2010.</p>

	<p>The Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 (MHPA) amended sections of the Employee Retirement
	Security Act, the Public Health Service Act and the Internal Revenue Code to require parity in
	aggregate lifetime and annual dollar limits for mental health benefits and medical and surgical
	benefits. MPHAEA amends the same sections of those laws and imposes additional requirements as
	well.</p>

	Perhaps the most significant change is that MHPAEA now extends the parity requirement to
	substance use disorder benefits. The original MHPA expressly excluded substance abuse or chemical
	dependency benefits from its parity requirements. This expansion of parity requirements will impact
	most group health plans that have to this point provided substance abuse benefits that are typically
	more restrictive than the mental health or medical/surgical benefits provided under the plan.
	<p>MHPAEA’s parity requirements apply to aggregate lifetime and annual dollar limits imposed by the
	group health plan as well as financial requirements and treatment limitations. Aggregate lifetime and
	annual dollar limits means dollar limitations on the total amount of specified benefits that may be
	paid under the group health plan or health insurance coverage. Parity regarding financial
	requirements and treatment limitations must be assessed separately for each of the following six
	classifications: inpatient services (in-network); inpatient services (out-of-network); outpatient
	services (in-network); outpatient services (out-of-network); emergency care; and prescription drug
	benefits. Financial requirements include deductibles, copayments, coinsurance and out-of-pocket
	maximums. Treatment limitations include benefit limits based on the frequency of treatment, number
	of visits, days of coverage, days in a waiting period, or other similar limits on the scope or duration of
	treatment. Treatment limitations may be quantitative, meaning the limitation is expressed
	numerically (e.g., 50 visits per year) or nonquantitative, meaning the limitation is defined in terms of
	medical management standards, formulary design for prescription drugs, methods for determining
	usual, customary and reasonable charges, step-therapy protocols or exclusions based on failure to
	complete a course of treatment. These regulations prohibit a plan or health insurance coverage from
	applying any financial requirements or treatment limitations to mental health or substance use
	disorder benefits in any classification that is more restrictive than the predominant financial
	requirement or treatment limitation applied to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in the same
	classification. This means, for example, that deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums may not
	accumulate separately for medical/surgical benefits and mental health/substance use disorder benefits.
	The regulations describe how to assess a plan’s benefit design with respect to the “more restrictive”
	and “substantially all” requirements.</p>

	<p>The regulations also provide numerous examples of how MHPAEA’s parity requirements would
	work in different scenarios. The examples indicate, for example, that a plan may not require
	concurrent review of in-patient mental health and substance use disorder benefits if the plan only
	requires retrospective review of in-patient medical/surgical benefits. Similarly a plan may not apply
	different benefit penalties for failure to obtain prior approval to mental health and substance use
	disorder benefits than apply to failure to obtain prior approval for medical/surgical benefits. This
	appears to mean that group health plans cannot require participants to access mental health benefits
	through an employee assistance plan, unless a similar requirement applies to medical/surgical
	benefits.</p>
	<p>The issuing agencies are requesting public comments on these regulations on or before May 3, 2010.
	The regulations are available at <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-2166.pdf" target="_blank">http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-2166.pdf</a>.</p>

	<p><b>SEX-CHANGE OPERATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE</b></p>

	<p>In a ruling on February 2, 2010, the U.S. Tax Court in Washington, D.C. held that medical expenses
	incurred in connection with a sex change operation to treat gender identity disorder are taxdeductible.
	The case is O’Donnabhain v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 134 T.C. (No. 4).</p>
	<p>O’Donnabhain claimed a tax deduction of over $21,000 in connection with sex reassignment surgery
	and related care and expenses. The IRS denied the deduction and imposed a tax liability of over
	$5,600. Under IRS rules, expenses incurred in connection with cosmetic surgical procedures
	generally are not tax deductible. The IRS had originally denied the claimed deduction under this rule.
	The Court concluded that O’Donnabhain’s surgical and related medical expenses treated a disease
	within the meaning of Section 213 and were therefore not cosmetic surgery. Accordingly the Court
	found that the expenses for these procedures were for “medical care” as defined in IRC section
	213(d)(1)(A), for which a deduction is allowed under section 213(a).</p>
	<p>As a result of this ruling, expenses incurred in connection with sex change surgery can be deducted as
	eligible medical expenses on an individual’s income tax filing, and can be reimbursed under Health
	Reimbursement Arrangements, Health Savings Accounts and health Flexible Spending Accounts. If
	an employer wishes to exclude coverage for such expenses under these qualified medical
	reimbursement plans, the applicable plan document will have to be amended to incorporate the
	exclusion.</p>

	<p><strong>CAL-COBRA INTERPRETATION</strong></p>
	<p>Both the Department of Managed Health Care and the Department of Insurance have interpreted
	California law to conform with the latest changes in the COBRA subsidy. The DMHC web site now
	specifically states that the eligibility period runs to February 28, 2010, and that the subsidy is
	available for up to 15 months. The DOI has informed us that their interpretation is the same.</p>
