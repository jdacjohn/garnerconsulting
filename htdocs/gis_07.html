<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1">

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">The following is a brief summary of some of the new laws affecting life, health and disability insurance in California.  Unless otherwise noted, the bills described here apply to contracts issued, amended, delivered or renewed on or after January 1, 2008.</p>

<p><b><i>Health Care Reform</i></b></p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">In 2007 the biggest issue on the table regarding health care was universal coverage.  Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared that health care would be his top policy priority this past year, releasing a reform proposal in January, and both the Governor and the Legislature have been active in the process of hammering out a plan that appeals to the most people possible.  The Governor and the Legislature's Democrats have both created plans, and managed to come to a compromise which was voted on by the Assembly on December 17. </p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">After the Governor vetoed AB8, the Democratic proposal, he released an amended version of his own proposal.  In response, Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez and Senate President pro Tem, Don Perata released a new Democratic health care proposal on November 6, as their "last and final" offer to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.  The new bill remains close to the basic principles of AB 8, the Democratic plan vetoed by the Governor in November, while meeting Schwarzenegger halfway on other elements of his plan.  </p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">
After long negotiations, the plan currently calls for universal coverage, covering more Californians than the original Democratic plan.  That means it will cost more, and the Democratic leaders propose putting a $1.50 to $2-per-pack cigarette tax on next year's ballot to help fund the program.  The plan also requires employers to spend between 1% and 6.5%, calculated on a sliding scale, of payroll costs on health care, or pay into a statewide insurance pool.  
</p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">On December 17 the bill made it out of committee and was passed by the Assembly with 46 of 77 possible votes.  The legislation will have to pass the Senate next year, as well as gain approval from voters.  With the plan estimated to cost $14 billion, and an expected budget shortfall for 2008 of $14 billion, the bill's chances are still questionable.  </p>

<p><b><i>Leave for Spouses of Service Members</i></b></p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">AB 392 became law in October and was immediately effective as an urgency measure.  The law requires employers to allow employees who are spouses of a qualified member of the armed services to take up to 10 days of unpaid leave in the event that their spouse is on leave from military deployment.  Employees must work an average of 20 or more hours per week and must provide notice to the employer of the need for the leave within two days of receiving official notice that the qualified member will be on leave.  A qualified member of the armed services is defined as a member who has been deployed during a military conflict to an area designated as a combat theater or combat zone by the President, or who is a National Guard or reserves member deployed during a military conflict.  </p>

<p><b><i>Support and Health Care Coverage for Disabled Dependents</i></b></p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">AB 910 changes the definition of a disabled dependent who is incapable of self-sustaining employment to include reasons of "physically or mentally disabling injury, illness or condition."  This is wider definition than in previous law and is intended to create the opportunity for more disabled children to continue to receive health coverage even after they have reached an age at which most children would be deemed ineligible as a dependent.  The law requires insurers to notify subscribers at least 90 days prior to the date on which a dependent would become ineligible, and also requires parents to provide information supporting the claim that their dependent should be able to continue coverage.  </p>

<p><b><i>Confidentiality of Medical Records</i></b></p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">Ab 1178 is intended to conform parts of California's medical information privacy laws to HIPAA.  The law is modified to except psychotherapists from the prohibition on sharing information in the event that he or she thinks the disclosure is necessary to prevent a serious threat to someone, and the disclosure is made to someone who is likely able to prevent any harmful acts.  </p>

<p><b><i>Confidentiality of Personal Information</i></b></p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">This bill expands the definition of "provider of health care" within the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act.  It now includes any corporation which is created for the purpose of maintaining medical information for treatment or diagnostic reasons.  The bill also adds "medical information" and "health insurance information" to the list of data that, when combined with the patient's name, constitutes "personal information."  Last, the bill allows consumer reporting agencies to disclose information that would be lawfully obtained from public records, even if the consumer has placed a security freeze on his or her records.  </p>

<p><b><i>San Francisco Health Care Security Ordinance</i></b></p>

<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">Although it is a city ordinance, this law has far-reaching effects.  The Health Care Security Ordinance (HCSO) requires covered employers to make health care expenditures for their covered employees and mandates the Department of Public Health to create the a health access plan called Healthy San Francisco.  Because covered employers include employers who engage in business in San Francisco, the ordinance requires businesses which are not located in the city to cover any employees who work in the city in any given week, unless the employees sign waiver forms.  Healthy San Francisco is only one option by which a covered employer can satisfy its obligation to make the required health care expenditure (HCE).  Covered employers may also make the required HCE in a variety of other manners.  </p>
