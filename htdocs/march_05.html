<b>IRS Weighs In On Canadian Drug Imports And CDHPs</b>

<p align="justify">With few exceptions, IRS Publication 502 makes clear that consumer-driven health plans such as Health Savings Accounts cannot be used to pay for prescription drugs imported from Canada or other countries. This rule includes drugs ordered and delivered from these countries. Drugs bought and used in another country and drugs categorized by the FDA as legal imports are two exceptions and may be paid for from such a plan with pre-tax dollars. The FDA has published a letter on its website emphasizing this point, and making clear not only the illegality of such imports but also the illegality of paying for them from consumer-driven health care accounts.

<p><b>Congressional Efforts To Tighten Tax Shelter Rules Threaten Section 125 Plans</b>

<p align="justify">As part of a general effort to eliminate loopholes and prevent noncompliance with current tax laws, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, in its recent report, suggested a change in the Social Security and Medicare taxation of pre-tax salary reductions used to pay for “cafeteria” plans. Payroll taxes are already levied on 401(k) contributions. Imposing Social Security and Medicare taxes on cafeteria plans would cost approximately $164 billion over 10 years.

<p align="justify">Organizations such as the Employers Council on Flexible Benefits are responding to the report by mobilizing government relations staff and their members to appeal for the preservation of such contributions’ entirely untaxed status. The burden to employees and employers would undoubtedly lead to an overall decrease in the number of dollars available for employees to spend on various benefits.

<p><b>DOL Issues USERRA Notice</b>

<p align="justify">On March 10, 2005, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) issued the final version of its new Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) notice. The government requires all employers to post the notice within a “reasonable” time.

<p><b>“Rain Delay”</b>

<p align="justify">The Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) has announced an extension of the deadline for filing Form 5500 and Form 5500 EZ annual report/returns due to damages from severe storms, flooding, and mudslides in California. The extension applies to plan administrators, employers, and other entities located in the affected areas, as well as firms located elsewhere who are unable to obtain the necessary information from service providers, banks, or insurance companies whose operations were directly affected by the disasters.

<p align="justify">According to the EBSA: “Under this relief, Form 5500 series filings required to be filed between December 27, 2004, and April 8, 2005, are granted an extension until April 8, 2005. Plan filers entitled to an extension of relief should check Part I, Box D on the Form 5500 or Part 1 on Form 5500-EZ and attach a statement to the form in accordance with the instructions.”

<p><b>Feds Offer More!</b>

<p align="justify">Two federal agencies have recently offered expanded information via their websites: the Treasury Department added to its Frequently Asked Questions about HSAs, increasing the number of questions from 58 to 85, and dividing these into 8 categories. Also, the Department of Labor has added a model initial COBRA notice in Spanish to its May 2004 model notice in English.

<p><b>Senate Passes Bill Prohibiting Genetic Discrimination</b>

<p align="justify">On February 17, 2005, the U. S. Senate passed S. 306, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2005, sponsored by Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine). This bill would prohibit group health plans and health insurance companies from requesting, requiring or purchasing genetic information for purposes of underwriting, to deny health coverage or raise premiums. The bill would also establish federal privacy standards and protections for genetic information. The bill would also prohibit employers from using genetic information to make employment decisions. A similar bill was approved by the Senate last year, but never considered in the House.

<p><b>HIPAA Security Deadline Approaching</b>

<p align="justify">April 20, 2005 is the deadline for compliance with the Security regulations issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 for health plans with $5 million or more in “receipts”. Receipts are defined as premiums for insured plans and claims for self-funded plans. If a plan, as defined in a Summary Plan Description and reported on Form 5500, includes both insured and self-funded components, each part must be added together to determine if the $5 million threshold is met. Plans with less than $5 million have until April 20, 2006 to come into compliance.
