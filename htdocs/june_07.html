<strong>Garner Consulting Celebrates 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary</strong>

<p><strong>Appelate Court Overturns Ban On EEOC Regs On Retiree Health Parity</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On June 5, the 3<sup>rd</sup> US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) can proceed with rules allowing employers to offer different benefits to retirees based on whether they have Medicare. The ruling overturned a US District Court ruling of last year, which barred the federal government from exempting employers from a discrimination rule regarding reducing benefits for retirees who are Medicare eligible. Last year’s decision, which upheld an injunction against the EEOC, barring the publishing or other implementation of their proposed rules, was based on a 2000 case, Erie County Retirees Association v. County of Erie.</p>

<p align="justify">According to the most recent opinion, the EEOC proposed the exemption rules in order to combat a trend it had seen since the Erie County case. Faced with the burden of having to offer full benefits to all retirees, rather than different benefits for early retirees and Medicare-eligible retirees, employers had been cutting retiree health benefits altogether. “It is clear that the EEOC’s proposed regulation was supported by the agency’s full consideration of the relevant factors, potential effects, and possible alternatives to such a policy, and was not arbitrary or capricious,” Chief Judge Jane Restani wrote in her opinion. Restani is a judge in the US Court of International Trade, and had been specially appointed to hear the case.</p>

<p><strong>IRS Floats New Rules For Bigger HSA Employer Contributions</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On June 1, the IRS proposed rules that should make HSAs more appealing to employers and employees alike who worry about exposing employees to too much risk with a high deductible. The proposed rules would allow for employers to accelerate their contributions if large bills come in early in the calendar year. The new rule does not apply to HSAs that are a part of Section 125 plans; these are already eligible for accelerated contributions, the announcement said.</p>
 
<p align="justify">Employers who wish to accelerate HSA contributions for one or some employees with high costs will have to do so uniformly for all of those eligible. Because some employees open HSAs without informing their employers, employers must provide written notice (acceptable if sent electronically) to all employees by January 15 stating that, if they inform the employer that they have accounts by the last day of February, the employer will contribute a comparable amount plus reasonable interest, by April 15.</p>
 
<p><strong>US Circuit Court Of Appeals Overturns Fine For Not Providing Plan Docs</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On May 18, the 3<sup>rd</sup> US Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court ruling in a case involving an employer who did not provide an employee with the company’s plan documents within thirty days of his request. The appellate court found that the employee’s request for documents was not clear enough, lacking the name of the specific document desired, and therefore the employer did not owe any fines for failing to provide the documents. The court did say, however, that it did not think that any future requests for documents should de-facto be considered inadequate because the name of the document is not mentioned in the request.</p>

<p><strong>Texas Legislators Proclaim Independence From GASB Requirements</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On May 22, the Texas state Senate added its approval to the unanimous House vote for a bill that would make Texas the first state to reject GASB rules regarding reporting of retirement benefit liabilities on current balance sheets. The bill is on its way back to the House for approval of amendments, and it is expected to make it into the hands of Governor Rick Perry for signature.</p>

<p align="justify">The bill’s author, Senator Robert Duncan, says that the legislation is not meant to allow Texas to ignore its liabilities.  The GASB rule, he says, does not take into account that Texas budgets and pays for retiree benefits in two year cycles. Also, the state does not guarantee retirement benefits to its workers, and benefits can be cut off at any time. Robert Attmore, who chairs the accounting standards board, said that this fact is irrelevant, because as of now there is an obligation in place.</p>

<p align="justify">The legislation allows state agencies to follow the rule if they want to, but the fact that many agencies are likely to skip it may have detrimental effects on the state’s credit rating.</p> 
 
<p><strong>Vermont Adds Worker's Comp Protection For Firefighters With Cancer</strong></p>

<p align="justify">Vermont Governor Jim Douglas signed a bill on May 15 that allows for firefighters to receive worker’s compensation benefits for up to 10 years after retirement, if they are diagnosed with certain cancers. The bill makes it clear that employers have to prove that these cancers (including leukemia, lymphoma, and cancers of the bladder, brain, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, liver, pancreas, skin or reproductive tract) are not work-related.</p> 
 
<p><strong>5500 Filing Relief For Those Affected By Kansas Tornadoes</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The US Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) released several announcements in May, amounting to an extension of the deadline for filing Form 5500 annual report/returns for those affected by the tornadoes in Kansas. This applies to plan administrators, employers and other entities located in directly affected areas as well as those who are unable to obtain the necessary information from service providers, banks or insurance companies whose operations were directly affected by the storms. Under this relief, Form 5500 series filings required to be filed between May 4 and July 5, 2007, are granted an extension until July 5. Filers who have additional questions may contact EBSA's EFAST Help Line at (866) 463-3278.</p>
