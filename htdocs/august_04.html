<p><b>IRS Issues Even More HSA Guidance</b>

<p align="justify">The Internal Revenue Service continues to issue guidance on the new Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) at a surprisingly rapid rate. On August 16, 2004, the IRS published Internal Revenue Bulletin 2004-33, which included Notice 2004-50 relating to HSAs. This notice expands on Notice 2004-2, which provided certain basic information about HSAs.

<p align="justify">Included in the guidance are the following:

<ul type="square">

<li>An employee who is otherwise eligible for an HSA will not be disqualified because he or she has a discount card entitling them to get health care at discounted rates.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>An employee who is otherwise eligible for an HSA will not be disqualified because he or she is covered under an Employee Assistance Program, disease management program or wellness program if the program does not provide significant benefits in the nature of medical care. Screening and preventive services are to be disregarded in determining whether a program provides significant benefits.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>An individual becomes eligible on the first day of the month if coverage under a high deductible health plan (HDHP) begins on the first of that same month; otherwise eligibility begins the first of the month following the date of coverage under the HDHP.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>HDHPs may impose reasonable lifetime limits. The Notice does not give a bright-line test, but an example does say that a $1 million lifetime maximum is reasonable.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Plans may be designed with reasonable benefit restrictions, but a restriction is reasonable only if significant other benefits remain available under the plan. One example of a reasonable restriction is a lifetime limit of $10,000 for fertility treatments. Another example says that a $10,000 annual maximum for a single condition is not reasonable.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Restricting benefits to usual, customary and reasonable amounts is a reasonable restriction on benefits.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Penalties for failures to obtain pre-certification are not subject to the out-of-pocket limit.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>The deductible limits for HDHPs are based on 12 months. If a plan’s deductible may be satisfied over a period longer than 12 months, the minimum annual deductible must be increased to take into account the longer period.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Preventive care generally does not include any service or benefit intended to treat an existing illness, injury or condition; however, in situations where it would be unreasonable or impractical to perform another procedure to treat the condition, any treatment that is incidental or ancillary to a preventive service also falls within the safe harbor for preventive care. For example, removal of polyps during a diagnostic colonoscopy is preventive care that can be provided before the deductible in an HDHP has been satisfied.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Drugs or medications are preventive care when taken by a person who has developed risk factors for a disease that has not yet manifested itself or not yet become clinically apparent or to prevent the recurrence of a disease from which a person has recovered. Examples include cholesterol-lowering medications to prevent heart disease, treatment of recovered heart attack or stroke victims with ACE inhibitors to prevent a recurrence and drugs or medications used as part of obesity weight-loss programs and tobacco cessation programs.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Eligible long-term care premiums are deductible medical expenses, but are limited to the annually adjusted amounts in Section 213(d)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code. Any excess premium reimbursements are includable in gross income and may be subject to a 10% penalty.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Employer matching contributions to HSAs do not satisfy the comparability rules, unless all employees happen to make the same contribution and therefore receive the same matching contribution. The conference report for the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act and Notice 2004-2 provide that the comparability rules do not apply to contributions to HSAs made through a cafeteria plan. Thus, where matching contributions are made through a cafeteria plan, the contributions are not subject to the comparability rule, but are subject to the Section 125 nondiscrimination rules.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Employers that make additional contributions to HSAs for all employees who qualify for the catch-up contributions do not satisfy the comparability rules, unless all employees qualify for the same additional contributions.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Compliance with the comparability rules is determined on a month-to-month basis.</li></ul>

<ul type="square">
<li>Employers can restrict HSA contributions to employees covered by an HDHP sponsored by the employer, but if the employer contributes to an HSA for one employee covered under a non-employer sponsored HDHP, the employer must contribute to HSAs for all employees covered under non-employer sponsored HDHPs.</li></ul>
