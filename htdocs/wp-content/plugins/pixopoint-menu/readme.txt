== Description ==

Adds an SEO friendly, accessible regular or dropdown menu to your WordPress blog. Visit the <a href="http://pixopoint.com/pixopoint-menu/">PixoPoint Menu Plugin page</a> for more information about the plugin, or the <a href="http://pixopoint.com/forum/index.php?board=4.0">PixoPoint forum</a> for help with adding the menu to your theme.

= New beta plugin available =
We have a version of the <a href="http://pixopoint.com/products/pixopoint-menu/">PixoPoint Menu plugin</a> available which has all of the features of the current version plus a bunch more. Visit the <a href="http://pixopoint.com/pixopoint-menu-plugin-beta-0-8/">beta plugin page</a> for more information.

= Live Demo =

To see a live demo of the plugin in action, please visit <a href="http://dunedinicehockey.co.nz/">our demo site</a>.

= Features =

* Control content will be displayed in the menu<br />
* Easy to use interface for modifying the design<br />
* Animation drodpown menus<br />
* Up to two menus<br />
* Plus much more<br />

= Changing the look of your menu =

You can style the menu by using our easy to use editor interface to create the perfect looking menu for your site. This system operates from your own site, but behind the scenes it sends your design preferences back to the PixoPoint server for processing. The required CSS data is then sent back to your WordPress install for it to be used in your menu. When you save your design, that CSS is saved into your WordPress database. The plugin only needs to access the <a href="http://pixopoint.com/">PixoPoint server</a> if you choose to modify the design in the future.

The <a href="http://pixopoint.com/pixopoint-menu/">PixoPoint Menu Plugin</a> can be implemented into any theme design, however the easiest way to set it up is to use a theme exported from the <a href="http://pixopoint.com/generator/">PixoPoint Template Generator</a>. Themes from the template generator integrate flawlessly with the plugin and do not require any theme editing. Simply activate your theme, then activate the plugin and the new menu will appear instantly. Visit the <a href="http://pixopoint.com/generator/">PixoPoint Template Generator</a> to get your own pre-supported theme.

Special thanks to <a href="http://transientmonkey.com/">Greg Yingling (aka malcalevak)</a> who was a massive help with optomising the code for this plugin.

== Installation ==

After you've downloaded and extracted the files:

1.  Upload the complete `pixopoint-menu` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory OR install it via the WordPress plugin repository browser<br />
2.  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress<br />
3a. Either: Add `<?php if ( function_exists( 'pixopoint_menu' ) ) {pixopoint_menu();} ?>` to your theme wherever you want the menu to appear (usually your header.php file).<br />
3b. Or: Create a theme with the <a href="http://pixopoint.com/generator/">PixoPoint template generator</a> which will automatically load the plugin menu<br />
3c. Or: Choose the "Auto theme support" option in the plugins admin panel and use a theme which is automatically supported such as <a href="http://themehybrid.com/">Hybrid</a>, <a href="http://thematic.com/">Thematic</a> or Thesis.
4.  Visit the "PixoPoint Menu" page in your WordPress settings menu<br />
5.  Control how the menu behaves via the plethora of different options
6.  Click the 'Load editor' button to modify the design via the easy to use editing panel<br />

= Easy installation =

The easiest way to setup the PixoPoint Menu Plugin is to use it with a theme specifically designed to support the plugin. All themes exported from the <a href="http://pixopoint.com/generator/">PixoPoint Template Generator</a> (which have dropdown menus) support this by default. Simply activate your theme, then activate the plugin and the new menu will appear instantly. Visit the <a href="http://pixopoint.com/generator/">PixoPoint Template Generator</a> to get your own pre-supported theme.

Some themes such as <a href="http://themehybrid.com/">Hybrid</a>, <a href="http://thematic.com/">Thematic</a> and Thesis allow the plugin to appear in the theme by choosing the 'Auto theme support' under 'Settings' in the plugins admin page. This option will also work in many other themes, it's worth trying  at least but we can't guarantee it will work (the theme requires <?php wp_page_menu(); ?> for it work).

If your theme doesn't already support the PixoPoint menu plugin then read on for simple instructions on how to integrate it into other themes ... it isn't very hard

= Premium Support =

For direct help via the plugin author please sign up for the <a href="http://pixopoint.com/premium-support/">PixoPoint Premium Support service</a>.

The <a href="http://pixopoint.com/premium-support/">PixoPoint Premium Support</a> option is ideal if you have insufficient time to fix any problems you may have or simply don't know much about coding. You will receive not only techinical support and access to the latest PixoPoint betas but they will also install the plugin and set it up on your site if needed. Customisations of the plugin are also done for some premium members, although we recommend asking first via the <a href="http://pixopoint.com/contact/">PixoPoint Contact Form</a> for such requests as some customisations may require extra payment depending on their complexity.

= Free support =

If you follow all of the instructions here, activate the plugin and find the menu is appearing on your site but looks  messed up, then the problem is probably caused by a clash between your themes CSS and plugins CSS. These problems can usually be remedied by removing the wrapper tags which surround the menu in your theme. For example, most themes will have some HTML such as <div id="nav"><?php wp_list_pages(); ?></div> which contains the existing themes menu. By placing the wp_page_menu() function between those DIV tags, the menu will often interact with that DIV tag. The solution is to either remove the DIV tag or to alter it's CSS so that it doesn't interact with the menu.

If you require further help with the plugin, please visit the <a href="http://pixopoint.com/pixopoint-menu/">PixoPoint Menu Plugin page</a> or the <a href="http://pixopoint.com/forum/">PixoPoint support forum</a>.

Please read the following tips to help have questions answered faster.<br />

* Where is your CSS?<br />
* What modifications have you made to the CSS?<br />
* What browsers are you having problems with?<br />
* What is the URL for your site?<br />
* Provide a link to the problem. Most problems can not be answered without actually seeing your site. If you don't want to install the plugin on your live site and don't have a test site to show us, then view the source code in your browser when you do have the plugin installed, save it to an HTML file and upload that somewhere so that we can see what the page looks like.<br />
* Do not bother providing us with HTML and/or CSS code snippets (without a link). There is very little we can do without seeing the entire page as most problems are caused by an obscure piece of CSS somewhere else on the page.<br />
* Let us know if you have modified the CSS. If it is modified we are unlikely to offer support for free. Rummaging through other peoples code is too time consuming sorry.<br />
* If you didn't paste your CSS into the WP plugins settings page, let us know which exact file it is in. Searching through a dozen CSS files in your theme trying to find your menu code is not fun.<br />

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get a fully customised version? =

Leave a message on the PixoPoint <a href="http://pixopoint.com/contact/">Contact Page</a> with your requirements and we will get back to you ASAP with pricing information. Alternatively you can sign up for our <a href="http://pixopoint.com/premium-support/">Premium Support</a> option which gives you access to our new dropdown, flyout and slider menu CSS generator, plus access to our premium support forum.

= Why can't the plugin do X, Y or Z? =

It probably can, we just haven't supplied instructions on how to do it. If you have any requests, then please leave them in the <a href="http://pixopoint.com/forum/index.php?board=4.0">PixoPoint menu support board</a>. We often update the plugin with new functionality and we're far more likely to include the functionality you want if we know there is a demand for it already.

= Why should I use this plugin? =

If you want to create a dazzling, custom designed menu without writing and bug fixing endless lines of code.

If you are having trouble making your posts easily accessible to your users without them having to rifle endlessly through pages of posts.

If you have been using a menu which requires javascript to work, then this plugin will allow more of your visitors to access your site.

If you want to have an easy way to style your dropdown menu. This plugin allows you to control exactly how your menu appears on your site via an easy to use interface. It is also 100% compatible with the code generated on the <a href="http://pixopoint.com/suckerfish_css/">Suckerfish Dropdown CSS Generator page</a>.

= Does it work for WordPress version x.x.x? =

We have only tested this plugin on WordPress 2.7+. If you are using a newer version of WordPress than the latest version supported then we suggest trying the plugin anyway. It shouldn't (in theory) break anything other than the plugin itself which you can just delete if it doesn't work.

= Why isn't the plugin in my language? =

The plugin supports localization using PO and MO files. If you provide a translation I am more than happy to include it in future releases. If you've translated the plugin please let us know by posting in our <a href="http://pixopoint.com/forum/">support forum</a>.
