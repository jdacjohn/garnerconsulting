	<p><b>HHS & FTC ISSUE FINAL ARRA SECURITY BREACH RULES</b></p>

	<p>On August 24 the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued an interim final rule to
	implement the security breach notification requirements required by The American Recovery and
	Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, commonly known as the "Stimulus Package"). On August 25 the
	Federal Trade Commission (FTC) followed by issuing its final rule on this subject. The HHS interim
	final rule under HIPAA's administrative simplification provisions will affect covered entities and their
	business associates and will be effective September 23, 2009. Due to concerns expressed during the
	public comment period and ambiguities in the statute, HHS will not impose sanctions for failure to
	provide the required notifications for breaches that are discovered before February 22, 2010. The FTC's
	final rule will affect other entities not covered by HIPAA are effective September 24, 2009, but again, full
	compliance with the FTC regulations will not be required until February 22, 2010.</p>

	<p>In this interim final rule, HHS has updated its guidance regarding when notification of a breach of
	unsecured protected health information (PHI) is required under its and the FTC's rules. Encryption and
	destruction remain the sole technologies and methodologies that satisfy the safe harbor allowing covered
	entities to avoid the notification requirements in the event of a security breach under this interim final
	rule. This updated guidance specifically notes that only destruction of paper PHI satisfies the safe harbor
	requirements; mere redaction of paper-based PHI is not sufficient. HHS also noted in the preamble that
	this updated guidance does not modify a covered entity's responsibilities under the HIPAA Security Rule
	nor does it require a covered entity to encrypt all PHI. HHS also noted that a covered entity may be in
	compliance with the Security Rule even if it reasonably decides not to encrypt PHI. However, should a
	covered entity choose to encrypt PHI, the guidance notes that covered entities and business associates
	should maintain encryption keys on a device separate from the data they encrypt or decrypt.</p>

	<p>HHS also clarified the definition of breach of PHI which would require notification to the individual or
	other parties. Under this clarified definition, a covered entity will need to perform a risk assessment to
	determine if there is a significant risk of harm to the individual as a result of the impermissible use or
	disclosure. If the nature of the PHI used or disclosed does not pose a significant risk of financial,
	reputational or other harm, then the violation is not a breach. Accordingly the risk assessment must be
	fact specific. The rule also provides additional details regarding the timing, content and method of
	notification to individuals, the media and HHS. HHS will post additional instructions on its web site
	regarding the annual notification of breaches involving less than 500 individuals and the notification to
	HHS for breaches involving 500 or more individuals.</p>

	<p>The FTC's final rule makes very few changes to the proposed rule published in April 2009. The changes
	result from the FTC's attempt to make its requirements consistent with HHS's interim final rule. Under
	this final rule the FTC has made sure that its regulations, which apply to vendors of personal health
	records and their third-party service providers and other related entities do not overlap with HHS's
	requirements in order to avoid consumers receiving multiple notifications of the same breach of electronic
	PHI.</p>

	<p>HHS and the FTC are requesting public comment on these rules. The HHS interim final rule is at

	<p><b>IRS ALLOWS DEPOSITING UNUSED VACATION AND SICK LEAVE TO 401(k)s</b></p>
	<p>In his weekly radio address on September 5, 2009, the President proposed a number of new initiatives to
	help families save for retirement. One of them is to allow unused leave to be converted to 401(k)
	savings. Accordingly, the IRS released Revenue Rulings 2009-31 and 2009-32 to clarify steps that
	employers can take immediately to contribute unused vacation and sick leave to 401(k) accounts. These
	rulings describe how employers can permit employees to convert the value of their unused leave into
	additional contributions to tax-qualified Section 401(k), profit sharing or stock bonus plans.
	Revenue Ruling 2009-31 has to do with amounts of leave that would be forfeited at year-end. Revenue
	Ruling 2009-32 has to do with unused leave at the time of termination.</p>

	<p>Employers are not required to make any changes, but the rulings give examples of the kinds of changes
	employers could make to their plans, if they choose to do so.</p>

	<p>The rulings say that because the amounts contributed will vary based on the amount of the participant's
	unused paid time off, the contributions are likely to preclude a plan from satisfying a design-based safe
	harbor. Therefore, testing based on the contributions made for individual participants generally will be
	required. Furthermore, contributions made pursuant to these arrangements must not exceed the Section
	415 limits.</p>

	<p>The rulings can be found at <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-09-31.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-09-31.pdf</a>

		<p><b>HEALTH CARE REFORM UPDATE</b></p>
	<p>	During the week of September 21, 2009, the Senate Finance Committee began to mark up (the process by
		which congressional committees and subcommittees debate, amend, and rewrite proposed legislation)
		health care reform legislation that many observers believe will become the basis for the final version of
		health care reform, if Congress is able to enact health care reform this year. Mark up of the bill will
		continue during the week of September 28, 2009 and possibly beyond.</p>

		<p>The bill in the Senate Finance Committee, written by chairman Max Baucus (D-MT) has yet to gather any
		support from Republicans. Now that the late Senator Kennedy (D-MA) has been replaced, Democrats
		and their independent allies in the Senate control 60 votes, so Republican support would not be needed to
		pass a bill, if Senator Byrd (D-WV) is healthy enough to vote. Even though the Democrats may have the
		votes needed to pass a bill, the President has repeatedly stated his preference for a bipartisan measure.</p>


	<p>	The Senate Finance Committee modified the bill submitted by Senator Baucus in a number of ways
		during the first week of debate, dealing with over 60 amendments (more than 500 remain to be
		addressed). Only four amendments proposed by Republicans were approved. One amendment that
		passed added more subsidies to help lower-income people buy insurance. Another amendment that was
		approved reduced proposed taxes on insurance plans with high premiums.
