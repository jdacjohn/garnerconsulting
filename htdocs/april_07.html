<strong>Both Washington State Legislative Houses Pass Healthcare Bills</strong>

<p align="justify">The Washington state House and Senate have both approved legislation geared toward accomplishing universal health care in the state. On April 13 a bill passed in the state House that includes a reorganization of the state insurance market, using subsidies and pooling for better rates and partnering with the federal government. The bill also encourages wellness programs for state employees as well as opening the University of Washington’s Health Science Library to online access for all.</p>

<p align="justify">The bill that passed the state Senate calls for a revamp of the current small employer health insurance partnership to create a larger pool, with a state board to act as a liaison between insurers and plan sponsors. If the House approves the Senate’s changes to the legislation, small employers with at least one low-wage worker would be able to provide coverage for all employees through the State pool. The State board would regulate aspects such as minimum employer contributions.</p>

<p align="justify">The Senate bill is opposed by some Republicans, who say that it does not do enough to support small businesses. A compromise between House and Senate bills has not yet been negotiated.</p>

<p><strong>Maine Governor Announces Plans for Universal Coverage</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On April 6<sup>th</sup>, Maine Governor Mike Baldacci announced plans for legislation that would expand health coverage for the currently uninsured. The planned legislation, which is meant to expand on the state’s 2003 health care access law, would include an individual mandate as well as a fee for employers who do not offer coverage.</p>

<p align="justify">Under the Governor’s proposal, insurers would be required to cut premiums for group policies at companies offering wellness programs, a 2% surcharge would be assessed on all hospital bills, individuals earning over 400% of the federal poverty level would be obligated to have health coverage, and the state would form a purchasing pool to assist small employers in getting good rates.</p>

<p align="justify">The 2003 program, called Dirigo Health, allowed small employers and individuals to get health insurance with subsidized coverage for some.  Dirigo Health currently covers 13,000 residents and has only had a small impact on the uninsured rate.</p>

<p><strong>Proposed Tax Break for Domestic Partner Coverage</strong></p>

<p align="justify">A Washington State Congressional Representative, Jim McDermott, has introduced legislation that would give employer-sponsored health benefits for domestic partners the same tax treatment as coverage for spouses. McDermott, citing everyone’s right to be treated equally and with dignity, said the bill would create a sense of fairness in the workplace. McDermott also said, noting the good work that some large Washington companies have done in offering equal benefits to domestic partners, that employers should not be forced to treat employees’ income differently depending on the legal status of their couplehood. He would rather the companies be encouraged and supported in their good work.</p>

<p><strong>Americans Still Worry About Health Information Privacy</strong></p>

<p align="justify">A nationwide poll by Harris Interactive shows that 17% of respondents are worried enough about the security of their health information that they keep some things secret from their own doctors. 50% believe that patients don’t have control over how their heath information can be used, though 31% are not worried and 19% are not sure about this issue.</p>

<p align="justify">There is a strong linkage between people’s health status and the level of their concern. For instance, 73% of people who rate their health as good or excellent are satisfied with privacy policies, and only 60% of those who rate their health as fair or poor feel the same. Overall, the majority of those polled were satisfied with the current state of privacy for health information, but the fact that some people may still be concerned enough to avoid necessary treatments is still a cause for concern.</p>

<p><strong>Workers Are Happy with Employer-Sponsored Health Care</strong></p>

<p align="justify">In a recent survey by the National Business Group on Health, most of those polled stated that they are very satisfied with their employer-sponsored health benefits. Of the 1,619 workers surveyed, the majority are unwilling to reduce their health benefits in favor of other benefits such as a retirement savings plan. Over two thirds are also very pleased with their particular health plan, rating it excellent or very good.</p>

<p align="justify">Most of those polled think that charging smokers more for health care is appropriate, but few would do the same for obese employees.  Workers are generally in favor of plans that are easier for them to manage, allow them to choose doctors, and limit out of pocket costs.</p>

<p align="justify">Workers also expressed their views regarding the financial aspects of their health benefits, with the following results:</p>

<ul><li>Workers are on the fence as to whether lower out of pocket costs or lower premiums are more important</li>
<li>Three quarters would rather have employer-sponsored group coverage than extra salary to buy their own coverage</li>
<li>More than half oppose the taxation of employer contributions to their premiums.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Congress Weighs in on Insuring Motorcycle Riders</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On April 2, bipartisan groups in both the House and Senate introduced legislation aimed at closing a loophole in HIPAA regulations, which, as written, forbids employers to refuse health coverage to employees who participate in dangerous sports, but allows insurers to deny benefits for claims resulting from such activities.</p>

<p><strong>Florida Lawmaker Pushes Rich Retirement for Mental Health Workers</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On April 11, a Florida state Senate committee approved a bill, proposed by state Senator Al Lawson, which will set the retirement benefits of employees who spend about 75% of their time caring for dangerous mental health patients at the same level as those for police and corrections officers. Lawson is asking for $8.1 million in funding from the state this year, citing the many injuries suffered by these workers. The mental health patients in question are often those who would be in prison if they were not believed to be mentally incompetent.</p>
