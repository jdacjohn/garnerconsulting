<strong>Medicare Forecast Still Looking Dismal</strong>

<p align="justify">The Social Security and Medicare Board of Trustees' report on their financial review of the programs, released on April 23, showed marginal changes in their predictions for the longevity of the funds. Compared to previous predictions, the report predicts one additional year of solvency before the money is gone. Medicare's hospital-insurance trust fund will be used up by 2019 if no changes are made to the program, and Social Security is projected to exhaust its funding in 2041 if no changes are made.</p>

<p align="justify">The Medicare program is more deeply challenged than Social Security due to rising health care costs, the report says. Existing law requires the programs to cut benefits across the board if the funds run out, a change that would affect some disabled persons as well as the elderly. The Medicare trust fund, which is also funded by payroll taxes, currently has a negative cash flow.</p>

<p align="justify">Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson stated that the report highlights the need to address the financial pressure on the programs that is building as the Baby Boom generation prepares for retirement. "The longer we delay, the larger the required adjustments will be &ndash; and the burden of making those adjustments will fall more heavily on future generations," said Paulson.</p>

<p align="justify">The Social Security program is now running at a surplus and disbursements are predicted to start outstripping its revenues by 2017, according to the report.

<p><strong>IRS Releases New HSA Contribution Limits And Deductible Requirements</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On May 11, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued Revenue Procedure 2007-36, providing inflation adjusted limits for health savings accounts (HSAs) for 2007 and 2008. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, the maximum annual HSA contribution is set to the indexed statutory amount, without reference to the deductible of the high deductible health plan (HDHP). For calendar year 2007, the maximum contribution for someone with self-only coverage under a high deductible health plan is $2,850; the maximum for someone with family coverage is $5,650. For calendar year 2008, the maximums are $2,900 and $5,800, respectively.</p>
 
<p align="justify">For calendar year 2008, the minimum deductible for an HDHP to be HSA-compliant is $1,100 for self-only coverage and $2,200 for family coverage, and the annual out-of-pocket maximum cannot exceed $5,600 for self-only coverage or $11,200 for family coverage.</p>

<p><strong>Maryland Attorney General Gives Up On Fair Share Act</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On April 17, 2007 Maryland Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler announced that the State would not appeal a federal court ruling that has struck down Maryland's "Fair Share" health care act. Stating that he felt appeal was likely to fail, Gansler opined that the attempt could take years and delay other more direct efforts to extend health coverage to the 800,000 Marylanders who lack health insurance.</p>

<p align="justify">The act, affectionately dubbed the “Wal-Mart law,” was not directly aimed at decreasing the number of uninsured in Maryland, but rather required businesses with more than 10,000 employees in the state to spend at least 8% of payroll costs on health care coverage or to pay into the state’s health care system.</p> 
 
<p align="justify">As previously reported in this Bulletin, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group of which Wal-Mart is a member, sued and won in federal court in Baltimore and in the 4<sup>th</sup> U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The group argued that the law violated the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which prohibits states from regulating benefit plans.</p>

<p align="justify">"Fair Share had a great impact in the state and on the nation," Gansler said at his announcement. "Today, Wal-Mart offers health care to more of its part-time employees and has drastically reduced co-payments for prescription drugs."</p>


<p><strong>No Premium Recovery In Case Of Paperwork Foul-up, Court Rules</strong></p>

<p align="justify">In the case of a woman whose employer failed to add one of her daughters as a dependent on the company’s group insurance policy, the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled on April 20 that she can’t get back her premium payments under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The employer had deducted additional premium payments and verbally assured the employee the additional coverage for the daughters was in place, but when one of the daughters had surgery the plan's insurer denied the resulting claim because the girl had not been added to the plan.</p>

<p align="justify">Even though the court agreed that the employer's plan administrator had breached his or her fiduciary duties by fouling up the paperwork between the employee and the insurance carrier, the plaintiff still can't sue for the return of her premiums under ERISA, the judge said.</p>

<p align="justify">Citing several Supreme Court rulings, the court concluded that, because the participant wasn’t seeking recovery of particular funds or property in the employer's possession, reimbursement of premiums did not constitute equitable relief under ERISA. Equitable relief is the only remedy allowed in cases of breach of ERISA fiduciary duty. The court did award the employee attorney’s fees and costs, saying that the "constrained remedies available under ERISA do little to deter other breaching fiduciaries in similar situations."</p> 
 
<p align="justify">The case is Hughes v. Legion Ins. Co., 2007 S.D. Tex.2007.</p>

<p><strong>ERISA Mum On Eligibility Contract Between HMO And Employer</strong></p>

<p align="justify">On April 27 the US District of South Carolina ruled that a health maintenance organization (HMO) could not sue an employer as a fiduciary under ERISA because it had not notified the HMO that an employee was no longer eligible. The HMO paid more than $650,000 in medical claims for a former employee of Auddie Brown Auto Sales of Florence, Inc., after the employee had been terminated. According to their contract, the employer was responsible for checking plan eligibility.</p> 
 
<p align="justify">The HMO, Carolina Care, sued Auddie Brown in state court, claiming negligence. Auddie Brown contended that the suit belonged in federal court, but the federal judge kicked it back to the state courts, saying that even though Carolina Care was a fiduciary when deciding claims under the employer's ERISA plan, it was not a fiduciary when relying on the employer's certification of eligibility status in paying claims.</p>

<p align="justify">The court further noted that the contract that required the employer to inform Carolina Care about eligibility changes was different from the terms of the employer's ERISA plan, and that the case would not require the court to interpret the ERISA plan at all.</p>

<p align="justify">The case is Carolina Care Plan, Inc. v. Auddie Brown Auto Sales of Florence, Inc, D.N.C. 2007.</p>
