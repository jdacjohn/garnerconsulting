<strong>Vermont Passes Legislation Aimed At Universal Health Coverage</strong>

<p align="justify">On May 11<sup>th</sup>, the Vermont Legislature approved a health care reform bill similar to the one passed recently in Massachusetts. It provides health care insurance subsidies for low income individuals. It also includes a penalty of $365 per employee for employers who do not provide health care coverage. The penalty does not apply to employers with eight or fewer employees, but it will be assesed for any employees who decline employer-sponsored coverage without having coverage elsewhere.</p>
  
<p align="justify">Republicans, in the minority in the state House, cited concerns with the vague definitions of benefits to be provided among their main concerns with the bill.</p>  

<p align="justify">Previously, the Vermont House had voted to pass legislation promising that the state would pay for health insurance for all Vermonters. That bill provided for health care subsidies for low-income citizens, calling for the state to provide primary care coverage to everyone in the state by July 2007, publicly funded hospital coverage by October 2007, and universal coverage for other medical needs by July 2009. The coverage was to be provided through a new insurance program sold by commercial insurers. It was defeated by the Vermont Senate.</p>  

<p><strong>Michigan Joins In The Game</strong></p>

<p align="justify">Also on May 11<sup>th</sup>, Michigan’s governor Jennifer Granholm unveiled a plan for universal healthcare in that state. The plan is an expansion of one announced in January, which was to cover state residents living below 200% of the federal poverty level. The new plan would offer insurance to those working poor above that level who do not have coverage. The state would subsidize premiums based on family income. The state plans to encourage small businesses to enter the program, and hopes to achieve near-universal coverage without mandating that individuals purchase coverage, as is being done in Massachusetts.

<p><strong>Tennessee Governor Signs Health Care Bill</strong></p>

<p align="justify">In mid-June, Governor Phil Bredesen signed into law a health care bill meant to help cover the state’s 600,000 plus uninsured. Called “Cover Tennessee,” the bill provides for low-cost health insurance at a rate of $200 per month: $50 paid by the state, with employees taking on the remainder of the $150 and employer contributions welcome.</p>

<p align="justify">The state expects 100,000 adults, 75,000 children and 15,000 “chronically ill” citizens to enroll in the next three years. Most people who earn less than 2.5 times the Federal poverty level would qualify. Bredesen expects the plan to be in effect in 2007, and though there is an expectation that at least two private insurers will offer coverage, none have committed as yet.</p>

<p align="justify">Governor Bredesen also suggested what he called “practical insurance:” a $10 generic drug benefit, $25 office visits, and limited emergency room and hospital care benefits.</p>
 
<p><strong>IRS Proposed Regs For Dependent Care Credit Released</strong></p>

<p align="justify">In late May, the IRS released proposed regulations for tax credits for household and dependent care expenses necessary for gainful employment. The proposed regulations include a change in the definition of a qualifying individual, a change in the maximum age of a qualifying child, an increase in the maximum amount of creditable expenses and an increase in the monthly amount of income a spouse who is a full time student or incapable of self-care can earn.</p>

<p align="justify">The IRS is welcoming written comments until August 22. The publication can be found at <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2006/pdf/E6-7390.pdf" target="_blank">http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2006/pdf/E6-7390.pdf</a>.

<p><strong>Utah Court Rules Domestic Partner Benefits Legal</strong></p>

<p align="justify">A state court ruled in late May that an ordinance in Salt Lake City that allows for same-sex domestic partners to enjoy some of the same benefits given to spouses is not against state law. The ordinance, which applies to benefits offered to city workers, was approved by the mayor last year and was appealed in September 2005. The state agency that provides health insurance asked the court to decide whether the ordinance violated Utah’s Defense of Marriage Law.</p>

<p align="justify">Since it was found to be legal, the ordinance, which took effect in March, will continue to provide a way for city workers to share health benefits with not only spouses and children, but with an “adult designee” and that person’s children.</p>

<p><strong>Sick Leave And FMLA Can Be Run Concurrently, 8<sup>th</sup> Circuit Court Rules</strong></p>

<p align="justify">The 8<sup>th</sup> U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in May that an employer can require employees to use sick leave concurrently with any Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave granted. In the case of a police officer in the city of Republic, MO, the court ruled that the city was not violating the officer’s FMLA rights by limiting his total leave to the 12 weeks granted through FMLA. Although the officer had additional sick leave accrued, the court said the city was not remiss in asking that he return to work with a doctor’s attestation of his ability to do so, or resign at the end of 12 weeks.</p>

<p align="justify">The court’s decision was accompanied by a dissenting opinion, in which Circuit Judge Heaney stated that the majority had ignored clear language in the statute that states “the taking of leave under section 2612 of this title [FMLA] shall not result in the loss of any employment benefit accrued prior to the date on which the leave commenced.”</p>
