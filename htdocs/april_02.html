<b>IRS Rules Weight-Loss Programs May Be Tax Deductible</b>

<p align="justify">On April 2, 2002, the Internal Revenue Service published Revenue Ruling 2002-19, explaining the conditions under which expenses for certain weight-loss programs may qualify as a medical deduction under Section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code. The cost of diet food cannot be deducted.

<p align="justify">The ruling does not necessarily change what is covered by a health plan. The ruling makes it permissible for a health plan to cover weight-loss programs, but most plans will have to be amended before such expenses could be covered. Many flexible spending accounts use the Section 213 rules to define what is a covered expense; for those plans, weight-loss programs will be covered retroactively, but filing limits will typically restrict claims to this calendar year.

<p><b>IRS Suspends Schedule F Filings</b>

<p align="justify">On April 22, 2002, the IRS published Notice 2002-24, which suspends the requirement to file a Form 5500 Schedule F for Section 125 cafeteria plans, Section 127 educational assistance plans and Section 137 adoption assistance programs. The suspension applies immediately, regardless of the due date of the Schedule.

<p><i>Garner Consulting can help you determine if a plan still needs to file a Form 5500</i>.

<p><b>MEDICARE's Life Expectancy Extended Again</b>

<p align="justify">Each year, the Trustees of the Medicare trust fund, report in detail on its financial condition. The 2002 report indicates that the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund will not be exhausted until 2030. As recently as 1996, the Trustees projected the trust fund would be exhausted in 2001. 

<p><b>Electronic Disclosure Regulations Finalized</b> 

<p align="justify">On April 9, 2002, the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration of the Department of Labor (DOL) published final regulations relating to the use of electronic communication and recordkeeping technologies by employee benefit plans. The final regulations differ from the proposed regulations in that electronic notices can satisfy requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) if the participant, beneficiary or other person entitled to receive plan disclosures consents to receiving documents electronically. Participants who have the ability to access documents in electronic form at work can also received ERISA-required notices electronically. This includes only participants who use the employer's electronic information system as an integral part of their duties. Therefore, employees who work at home or traveling sales people who regularly connect to the system could be given only electronic notices, but employees on an assembly line who have a kiosk available, but that is not used as part of their duties, would have to receive paper notices. The final regulations eliminate a requirement in the proposed regulations that participants have the ability to print copies of electronic documents in order for electronic distribution to satisfy the ERISA requirements. Since participants receiving electronic notices have the right to request paper versions, the DOL realized that the requirement to have a printer was redundant.

<p align="justify">The other significant change from the proposed regulations is that electronic distribution can be used for all ERISA-required notices. The proposed regulations only applied to summary plan descriptions and related disclosures and Summary Annual Reports. The final regulations also allow electronic distribution for such things as qualified medical child support orders, COBRA notices, explanations of benefits and certificates of creditable coverage.
