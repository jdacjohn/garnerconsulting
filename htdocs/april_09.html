	<p><b>HHS AND FTC RESPOND TO ARRA's SECURITY BREACH REQUIREMENTS</b></p>
	<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, commonly known as the "Economic
	Stimulus Package") required both the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Federal
	Trade Commission (FTC) to address the problem of securing an individual's private health information
	from security breaches. On April 17 HHS responded by issuing guidance on this subject and on April 20
	the FTC responded by issuing proposed regulations. The HHS guidance under the Health Insurance
	Portability and Accountability Act's (HIPAA's) administrative simplification provisions will affect
	"covered entities" and the FTC's proposed regulations will affect other entities not covered by HIPAA.
	</p>
	<p>
	The HHS guidance identifies technologies and methodologies to make protected health information (PHI)
	in paper or electronic form unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals. The
	guidance identifies encryption and destruction as the two methods that will satisfy the requirements, and
	notes that these methods are exhaustive and not merely illustrative. The guidance specifies encryption
	and destruction processes or technologies that meet the required standards. Implementing these processes
	will create a "safe harbor" for covered entities, allowing them to avoid the notification requirements in the
	event of a security breach. The guidance will apply to breaches that occur 30 or more days after HHS
	issues interim final breach notification regulations.
	</p>
	<p>
	The FTC's proposed regulations apply to vendors of personal health records (PHRs) and related entities,
	and would require them to notify affected individuals and the FTC when a security breach is discovered.
	The regulations contain most of the same defined terms as the ARRA and clarify some of them. For
	example, a "breach" involves unauthorized "acquisition" of PHR information and not necessarily simply
	unauthorized access to the information. Examples of PHR information include a database containing
	names and credit card information even when no personal medical information is included. Under the
	regulations the notification requirements extend beyond vendors of PHR to their third-party service
	providers and other "related entities." These entities must provide notification of a security breach
	"without unreasonable delay" and in any event within 60 calendar days after the discovery of the breach.
	Depending on the nature and scope of the breach, notification must be made to the affected individuals, to
	media outlets and to the FTC and the notification must include steps affected individuals can take to
	minimize any harm resulting from the breach of the PHR information. The proposed regulations would
	apply to breaches discovered on or after September 18, 2009.
	</p>
	<p>
	HHS and the FTC are requesting public comment on the proposed regulations. The HHS guidance is at

	FTC's proposed regulations are at <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-8882.pdf"

	<p><b>ACT BY MAY 28 TO SUBMIT COMMENTS ON MENTAL HEALTH PARITY</b></p>
	<p>Employers still have an opportunity to shape the finer details of the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici
	Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA), which amended the Mental Health
	Parity Act of 1996 (MHPA).
	</p>
	<p>
	Most employers, operating with calendar-year health plans, must comply with the new parity law
	beginning January 1, 2010. Congress has finished its work, but three federal agencies are now charged
	with developing implementing regulations, and they are obligated to seek and respond to public input.
	This is more than a formality. Implementing regulations can have tremendous impact on the way a law is
	enforced, and how much burden it places on employers.
	</p>
	<p>
	The Internal Revenue Service, the Employee Benefits Security Administration, and the Centers for
	Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (parts of the Departments of Treasury, Labor and Health and Human
	Services, respectively) have requested comments about issues related to the new MHPAEA law.
	Comments are due on or before May 28, 2009.
	</p>
	<p>
	The Departments are requesting comments that may contribute to the analyses that will be performed
	under these requirements, both generally and with respect to the following specific areas:
	<ol type="i">
	<li> What policies, procedures, or practices of group health plans and health insurance issuers may
	be impacted by MHPAEA? What direct or indirect costs would result? What direct or indirect
	benefits would result? Which stakeholders will be impacted by such benefits and costs?
	<li> Are there unique costs and benefits for small entities subject to MHPAEA (that is, employers
	with greater than 50 employees that maintain plans with fewer than 100 participants)? What
	special consideration, if any, is needed for these employers or plans? What costs and benefits
	have issuers and small employers experienced in implementing parity under State insurance laws
	or otherwise?
	<li> Are there additional paperwork burdens related to MHPAEA compared to those related to
	MHPA, and, if so, what estimated hours and costs are associated with those additional burdens?
	</ol>
	<p>
	Comments may be submitted to the Department of Labor via email to <a href="mailto:E-OHPSCA.EBSA@dol.gov">E-OHPSCA.EBSA@dol.gov</a>. The
	Department of Labor will share the comments with the other Departments.
	</p>
	<p><b>SWINE FLU PANDEMIC THREAT SHOULD PROMPT REVIEW OF PROCEDURES</b></p>
	<p>
	The threat of a pandemic resulting from the emergence of a new form of flu, referred to as H1N1, should
	prompt employers to review and update procedures for coping with a pandemic.
