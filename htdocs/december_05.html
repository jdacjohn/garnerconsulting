<b>Guidance Issued For FSA/HSA Grace Period</b>

<p align="justify">In late November the IRS issued Notice 2005-86, laying out ramifications of an FSA grace period on HSA eligibility. The notice states that participants in a Health FSA with a grace period will not be eligible to establish or make tax-advantaged contributions to an HSA until the first day of the first month after the grace period ends. This is the case even if the individual has no rollover balance during the grace period.  

<p align="justify">As regards administration of a grace period, the rule states that employers must offer the grace period to all individuals who are covered as active participants in the plan, as of the last day of the plan year. This includes not only active employees but also former employees with COBRA coverage, as well as qualified ex-spouses and former dependent children who have made a COBRA election. Employers may choose to apply the grace period to one benefit but not to another, for example extending it for Health FSAs but not for Dependent Care FSAs. It also appears that it may be possible to establish differing FSA plans for employees with differing health coverages, so as to create an FSA plan specifically to complement HSA/HDHPs. 
 
<p align="justify">The Notice also allows for the conversion of a Health FSA to make it compliant with HSA rules. There are some important issues to consider, however. First, employers who convert their FSA plans for the duration of the grace period must do so for all employees, regardless of their enrollment in HSA/HDHPs. There is transition relief: for plan years ending on or before June 5, 2006 eligible individuals with FSA "coverage" due to a grace period will be allowed to establish or make contributions to an HSA if there are no carryover funds in the account. In addition, employers can amend their plans to exclude participants in HDHPs from the grace period, but just during the transition period. For any plan year ending after June 5, 2006, the grace period would have to be offered to everyone, and the limitations on an FSA plan would have to apply to everyone.  

<p align="justify">In addition, there is a lack of clarity regarding the use of post-deductible FSAs. This new guidance suggests that it is not possible to reimburse expenses generally excluded from an HDHP, such as over-the-counter drugs, if they are incurred before the HDHP deductible is met. This means that employees would possibly have normally-reimbursable expenses which can never be reimbursed, because of having been incurred before the deductible is met. The Notice is also not clear on whether an individual with single HDHP coverage but whose family is covered by a Health FSA, would be able to tap into those funds after the single deductible has been met, or only after the family deductible has been met. However, Revenue Rule 2004-45 indicates that a Health FSA or HRA can have a separate deductible as long as it satisfies the minimum deductible requirements of Code Section 223. This rule could provide a way to structure the FSA or HRA so as to reimburse appropriate expenses regardless of when they are incurred, but not until the HDHP deductible has been met.  

<p align="justify">As in the last article in this <i>Bulletin</i> (June 2005) on the new FSA grace period, Garner Consulting concludes that, though the grace period could be a boon to many employees, it is certain to cause employers and plan sponsors some headaches as long as the regulations remain less than clear.  

<p><b>House Approves Pension Bill With FSA Rollover Language</b>

<p align="justify">In mid-December the House approved a pension bill which included language (added in the Ways and Means committee) allowing for a carryover of FSA funds up to $500. This rollover would be possible for both Health and Dependent Care FSAs, and Health FSA amounts could be transferred to an HSA. The corresponding pension bill was passed in the Senate in November, not including this language. There will likely be a push by employer groups to encourage the Senate to approve this aspect of the bill; an intense conference with the Senate is predicted.  
 
<p><b>House Considers Bill To Ease HSA Requirements</b>

<p align="justify">On December 15<sup>th</sup> Republican Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia introduced a bill to eliminate the link between the limit on HSA contributions and the deductible on the account holder's high-deductible health plan (HDHP). Rather than limiting annual contributions to the amount of the deductible, it would allow individuals to contribute to the limit posted by the IRS. The legislation would also permit the individual to hold both an HSA and FSA or HRA, while limiting annual contributions to these accounts so that the total of all contributions does not exceed the out-of-pocket maximum for the HDHP.
  
<p><b>General Motors Gets Agreement On Plan To Save Health Care Dollars</b>

<p align="justify">In mid-November the automotive giant, General Motors, succeeded in obtaining the agreement of hourly workers to a plan which will save the carmaker about $1 billion in cash each year. Hourly workers will have to contribute one dollar per hour in future pay increases to a fund to help pay for retiree coverage. Retirees will have to pay up to $752 per year for a family and $370 per year for single coverage. They have not had to pay any premiums for this coverage up to now.  

<p align="justify">The tentative agreement is thought to create a 25% ($15 billion) savings on the company's health care liability for hourly workers. The plan should cut about $3 billion from GM's annual health care expenditure before taxes. The agreement also includes the creation of an independent Defined Contribution Voluntary Employee Benefit Association (VEBA) to help offset the new costs to hourly retirees. The VEBA will be partially funded by GM, with $1 billion contributions expected to be made in 2006, 2007 and 2011.  

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Circuit Court Of Appeals Rules In FMLA-Related Case</b>

<p align="justify">A woman who was terminated when she planned to come back from a Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave won the support of the 6<sup>th</sup> US District Court of Appeals on December 13<sup>th</sup>, 2005. The plaintiff complied with her employer's request to provide status reports every 30 days. Prior to returning to work, the plaintiff provided a note from her doctor certifying her ability to return to work.  

<p align="justify">The company requested a more detailed certification and, when the plaintiff failed to provide it, terminated her employment. The recent decision by the Court of Appeals stated that an employer may require a fitness-for-duty certification as a condition for returning to work, but may not mandate the amount or type of information included in the certification. The court did, however, uphold that an employer is within its rights to terminate employment if an employee fails to provide <i>any</i> certification.  

<p align="justify">Brumbalough v. Camelot Care Centers, 6<sup>th</sup> Cir., No. 04-5543 (November 2, 2005)

<p><b>USERRA Regulations Issued</b>

<p align="justify">The Veterans Employment and Training Service (VETS) on December 19<sup>th</sup> issued a final rule to make the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) more understandable to employers and employees alike. The new regulations address both employer and employee obligations in terms of such issues as: employee and employer contributions to pension plans, continued group health coverage and the coordination of USERRA and FMLA.  

<p align="justify">The new regulations also include a final rule regarding notice requirements. Employers can meet the requirements by either distributing the notice or posting the poster version in a place accessible to all employees. The poster can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.dol.gov/vets" target="_blank">www.dol.gov/vets</a>. In addition, the elaws advisor at <a href="http://www.dol.gov/elaws/userra.htm" target="_blank">www.dol.gov/elaws/userra.htm</a> has been updated to reflect the new rules.
