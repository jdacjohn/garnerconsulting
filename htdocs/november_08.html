<b>DEPARTMENT OF LABOR PUBLISHES FINAL FMLA REGULATIONS</b>
</p>
<p align="justify">
	On November 17, 2008, the Department of Labor published final regulations governing the Family and
	Medical Leave Act (FMLA). The regulations will be effective January 16, 2009. Because the regulations are
	so extensive, this issue of our bulletin will only address the military family leave portion of the regulations and
	other aspects will be covered in our December bulletin.</p>
	
	<p align="justify">
	Amendments to the FMLA enacted earlier this year allow eligible employees to take leave for a qualifying
	exigency arising out of the fact that a spouse, son, daughter or parent is on active duty or has been notified of
	an impending call to active duty in support of a contingency operation.</p>
	
	<p align="justify">
	The rule defines qualifying exigency by providing a specific and exclusive list of reasons for which an
	employee can take leave because of a qualifying exigency. These reasons are:</p>
	
	<p align="justify">
<ul>	<li>Short-notice deployment is to address any issue that arises from an impending call to active duty
	seven or less calendar days prior to the date of deployment.</li><br>
	<li>Military events and related activities is to attend any official ceremony, program or event and to
	attend family support and assistance programs and informational briefings sponsored or promoted by
	the military, military service organizations or the American Red Cross that are related to the active
	duty or call to active duty status of a covered military member.</li><br>
<li>	Childcare and school activities is to arrange childcare or attend certain school activities for a child
	under age 18 (or older if incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical disability at the
	time that FMLA leave is to commence).</li><br>
	<li>Financial and legal arrangements is to make or update financial or legal arrangements to address the
	covered military member's absence while on active duty, such as preparing and executing powers of
	attorney, transferring bank account signature authority, obtaining military ID cards or preparing or
	updating a will or living trust.</li><br>
	<li>Counseling is to attend counseling provided by someone other than a healthcare provider for oneself,
	for the covered military member or for a child under the age of 18 (or older, if incapable of self-care
	because of a mental or physical disability at the time that FMLA leave is to commence) if that the
	need for counseling arises from the active duty or call to duty.</li><br>
	<li>Rest and recuperation is to spend time with a covered military member who is on short-term,
	temporary rest and recuperation leave during the period of deployment.</li><br>
<li>	Post-deployment activities is to attend arrival ceremonies, reintegration briefings and events and any
	other official ceremony or program sponsored by the military for 90 days following the termination of
	active duty and to address issues that arise from the death of a covered military member on active
	duty, such as meeting the body and making funeral arrangements.</li><br>
	<li>Additional activities is to address other events which arise out of the covered military member's
	active duty or call to duty provided that the employer and employee agree.</li></ul></p>
	

	
	<p align="justify">
	The rule defines a "son or daughter on active duty or call to active duty status" as a child of any age.
	The rule clarifies that leave because of a qualifying exigency only applies to a call to active duty by members
	of the Reserve, the National Guard and certain retired members of the Armed Forces.
	The rule also provides that a call to active duty refers to a Federal, as opposed to State, call to duty.
	An employer may require a copy of the active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military. The
	regulations include an optional form that may be used. An employer can require an employee to provide a
	reasonable amount of information for certification of the need for leave. Employers may contact third parties
	to verify a meeting and the nature of the meeting.</p>
	
		<p align="justify">
	Another part of the amendments made to the FMLA is a provision that allows an eligible employee who is the
	spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin of a covered service member to take a total of 26 weeks of leave
	during a single 12-month period to care for the service member. An employee may take FMLA leave to care
	for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty for which the
	service member is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy or is on the temporary disability
	retired list. The rule does not require that a service member be receiving treatment from a Department of
	Defense (DOD) health care provider.</p>
	
		<p align="justify">
	The rule clarifies that "covered service member" includes current members of the Armed Forces, National
	Guard or Reserves as well as members who are on the temporary disability retired list.
	The regulations define "son or daughter of a covered service member", "parent of a covered service member"
	and "next of kin"-all of which are new terms applicable only to the taking of military caregiver leave. A
	parent does not include a parent-in-law.</p>
	
		<p align="justify">
	The rule defines a service member's next of kin as the service member's nearest blood relative, other than the
	spouse, parent, or child, in the following order: blood relatives who have been granted legal custody, siblings,
	grandparents, aunts and uncles, and first cousins, unless the service member has specifically designated in
	writing another blood relative as his or her nearest blood relative for purposes of military caregiver leave. The
	rule provides that all family members sharing the closest level of familial relationship to the service member
	shall be considered the next of kin.</p>
	
		<p align="justify">
	The rule provides that a request to take military caregiver leave may be supported by a certification that is
	completed by an authorized health care provider. The regulations include an optional form that may be
	used.</p>
	
		<p align="justify">
	The 26-week entitlement is to be applied as a per-service member, per-injury entitlement. An employee is
	limited to no more than 26 weeks in any 12-month period, even where leave is to care for multiple
	service members. If an employee does not use the entire 26 weeks during the 12-month period the
	remaining time is forfeited. The 12-month period for military caregiver leave begins on the first day the
	employee takes leave.</p>
	
		<p align="justify">
	If a leave would qualify as both military caregiver leave and regular FMLA leave, it must be designated
	as military caregiver leave.
