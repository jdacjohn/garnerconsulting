<b>Sarbanes-Oxley Act Signed Into Law</b>

<p align="justify">On July 30, President Bush signed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which is intended to protect benefit plan participants, in addition to the corporate and accounting reform stipulations it contains. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act expands penalties for ERISA violations, including individual fines of up to $100,000 (raised from the previous $5,000 maximum) or 10 years in prison (previously 5 years maximum). Additionally, fines against corporations can now be up to $500,000 (up from $100,000).

<p><b>Final HIPAA Privacy Regulations Published</b>

<p align="justify">On August 14, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published the final regulations for the Privacy Rule, which is effective April 14, 2003 for most covered entities and April 14, 2004 for small health plans.

<p align="justify">Some of the highlights, including changes made from the proposed regulations, are as follows:

<ul type="square">

<li>The final regulations exclude three categories of communications from the definition of "marketing". Thus, a covered entity is not engaged in marketing when it communicates to individuals about: (1) the participating providers and health plans in a network, the services offered by a provider, or the benefits covered by a health plan; (2) the individual's treatment; or (3) case management or care coordination for that individual, or directions or recommendations for alternative treatments, therapies, health care providers, or settings of care to that individual. The final regulations also allow covered entities to use protected health information to convey information to beneficiaries and members about health insurance products offered by the covered entity that could enhance or substitute for existing health plan coverage. Moreover, the expanded language makes clear that it is not marketing when a health plan communicates about health-related products and services available only to plan enrollees or members that add value to, but are not part of, a plan of benefits.</li>

<li>Consent is optional for routine health care purposes, which includes treatment, payment, and operations. This crucial change will allow health plans to disclose information for enrollment, disenrollment and underwriting without obtaining the consent of the employee.</li>

<li>In instances of mergers or ownership changes, protected health information may be transferred as part of such a process.</li>

<li>Employers are allowed to require certain health information be provided as a condition of employment and such medical information, as part of an employment record, is not protected health information.</li>

<li>"Incidental uses or disclosures" are not violations of the Privacy Rule, provided that the minimum necessary requirements and safeguards have been met.</li>

<li>Protected health information can be revealed without authorization "for public health purposes related to the quality, safety or effectiveness of FDA-regulated products or activities such as collecting or reporting adverse events, dangerous products, and defects or problems with FDA-regulated products."</li>

<li>Patients need to authorize non-routine use or disclosure, but separate forms are not necessary. A single consent form for research is also acceptable.</li>

<li>Any use or disclosure for which authorization has been given is exempt from the minimum necessary standard.</li>

<li>Covered entities (excluding small health plans) have an additional year to alter contracts regarding the business associate stipulations. A health plan may continue to operate until April 14, 2004 under an existing contract with a business associate if the written contract is in place by October 15, 2002 and it is not renewed or modified before April 14, 2003. Automatic renewals under evergreen provisions will not prevent a plan from qualifying for the extension.</li>

<li>In the final regulations, HHS changed the "model" provisions for a business associate contract to "sample" provisions. Most plans will need to augment the sample provisions with additional language that addresses such subjects as indemnification, transfer of information at contract termination and the right to audit.</li>

<li>Information that does not contain any identifiable information may be used for research, operations, or public health.</li>

<li>Plans are required to issue privacy notices to every individual covered by the plan (however others, such as the plan sponsor, may do the actual distributing of such information).</li>

</ul>

<p><b>COBRA Subsidy Part Of Trade Act Of 2002</b>

<p align="justify">Benefits for workers who are unemployed due to production being moved overseas or competition with imports have been expanded in the Trade Act of 2002, which President Bush signed into law on August 6. Such benefits are known as trade adjustment assistance and one new benefit is that such workers are eligible for a tax credit for 65% of premiums paid for some types of medical coverage, including COBRA. Workers who become eligible for this tax credit receive a second COBRA election period. The subsidy is available to individuals who lose their jobs due to foreign competition and to retirees ages 55 through 64 whose pension plans are taken over by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and who do not have health benefits.
