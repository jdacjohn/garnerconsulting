<strong>DOL PROPOSES NEW REGULATIONS ON FEE DISCLOSURE UNDER ERISA</strong>

<p align="justify">On December 13, 2007, the Department of Labor (DOL) proposed regulations on fee disclosures.  Section 406 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) generally prohibits the furnishing of goods, services or facilities between a plan and a party in interest to the plan.  Section 408(b)(2) of ERISA exempts certain arrangements between plans and service providers that otherwise would be prohibited transactions under Section 406.  Specifically, Section 408(b)(2) provides relief from ERISA's prohibited transaction rules for service contracts or arrangements between a plan and a party in interest if the contract or arrangement is reasonable, the services are necessary for the establishment or operation of the plan and no more than reasonable compensation is paid for the services.  In these proposed regulations, the DOL clarifies the meaning of "reasonable".  In order for a contract or arrangement to be reasonable under the proposed regulations, it must require that certain information be disclosed by the service provider to the responsible plan fiduciary.  The proposed regulations require those who provide services to ERISA plans to disclose any compensation, direct or indirect, monetary or in the form of items worth money.  </p>




<strong>CALIFORNIA SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE NIXES COMPROMISE HEALTH BILL</strong>

<p align="justify">After an 11-hour hearing on the bill and a delay in voting, at the request of President Pro Tem Senator Don Perata, the long-sought compromise health care reform bill, ABX1 1, was defeated in the Senate Health Committee.  The bill, which called for universal coverage and required employers to spend between 1% and 6.5% of payroll costs on health care, or pay into a statewide insurance pool, was the result of long negotiations between Legislative Democrats and the Governor.   </p>



<strong>APPEALS COURT STAYS SF HEALTH CARE MANDATE INJUNCTION</strong>

<p align="justify">On January 10, 2008, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the right of the City of San Francisco to implement its new health care mandate.  Overturning a District Court finding that the mandate portion of the Healthy San Francisco health care plan violates federal law, the court stated that the law does not require employers to establish ERISA plans or make changes to ERISA plans, and therefore the law is not pre-empted by ERISA.  </p>


<strong>COURTS DECIDE IN FAVOR OF INSURERS IN THREE AD&D CASES</strong>

<p align="justify">On January 3, 2008, the 4th US District Court of Appeals decided in favor of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. in a case involving the death of a man due to a bee-sting allergy.  Citing the fact that the allergy was a pre-existing condition, the court upheld the denial of accidental death benefits.  The deceased's wife claimed that the death was due to the accidental stinging of her late husband, and that the allergy was a dormant condition, but the 4th District found that whether the allergic condition was dormant or not, it was the allergy, and not the sting, that caused the death in question.  </p>

<p align="justify">Also, in late December, the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania agreed with the Life Insurance Company of North America that accidental death benefits were not due to the estate of a man who died in a traffic accident that was most likely caused by his diabetes-related hypoglycemia.  Finding that the deceased's accident was indeed caused by the condition, the court stated that the insurance company was within its rights in denying the claim, since the policy had a written exclusion for death caused directly or indirectly by a pre-existing bodily condition.  </p>

<p align="justify">The US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan decided on January 10, 2008 that Jefferson Pilot Financial Insurance Co. was correct in denying accidental death benefits in the case of a woman who was killed in a car accident and also found to have illegal drugs in her system.  The court ruled that the insurance company had compelling evidence that the accident was caused by the deceased, and that the drugs in her system could have contributed to the cause of the collision.  The deceased's husband argued that the evidence was not compelling, but failed to provide compelling evidence to the contrary.  </p>

<strong>FMLA EXPANSION HEADS TO THE WHITE HOUSE </strong>

<p align="justify">On January 23, 2008, the Senate passed a Defense Department Authorization bill, including language that would expand the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA).  The new law would expand FMLA to cover 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the spouse, parent or child of an active duty service member who is called up for duty.  The bill also increases the current limit on medical leave that a family member can take in the event that a service member is injured in the line of duty, from 12 weeks to 26.  This bill, if signed, would constitute the first expansion of FMLA since it was passed 15 years ago.  The expansion had previously been vetoed, as a part of a different defense bill.  </p>


<strong>DEPARTMENT OF LABOR PROPOSES FMLA CHANGES</strong>



<p align="justify">The Department of Labor (DOL) on January 28 sent proposed revisions to the FMLA to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  The revisions would address the need for medical certification of leaves, waivers, FMLA notices and guidelines for the beginning of approved leave.  The revisions do not address the very broadly defined term "serious health condition," which causes many administrative headaches for employers.  The OMB has 90 days to review the proposal, and then will either publish the revisions in the Federal Register, or return them to the DOL for corrections.  </p>


<strong>YOU CAN'T WAIVE USERRA RIGHTS, CA APPELLATE COURT RULES</strong>



<p align="justify">In late December the California Court of Appeal for the Fourth Appellate Division ruled that any contract regarding the waiver of USERRA rights is unenforceable.  The case of Brian Perez v. Uline, Inc. et al. involved a captain in the US Marine Corps Reserves, who, when returning from active duty was told that his employer no longer needed his services.  He was given a "Severance Agreement and Release" that would have paid him six weeks' salary severance in return for releasing the employer from all claims in a long, but not exclusive list of federal and state laws.  Against the advice of the employer, Perez signed the waiver without consulting an attorney even though his employer advised him to do so. </p>

<p align="justify">Subsequently the former employee sued and claimed wrongful termination and violations of USERRA, as well as other claims. The trial court upheld the waiver agreement. However, in its decision the California Court of Appeal determined that the plaintiff could not be held to the terms of the waiver agreement, pointing out that in 30 U.S.C. section 4302(b), USERRA "supersedes any State law ... contract, agreement, ... or other matter that reduces, limits, or eliminates in any manner any right or benefit" available under USERRA.  The court decided only that the waiver agreement that Perez signed was not enforceable under USERRA and did not decide if Perez' termination was because of his military service.</p>
