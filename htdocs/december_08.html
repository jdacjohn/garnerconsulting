	<p><b>DEPARTMENT OF LABOR PUBLISHES FINAL FMLA REGULATIONS</b></p>

	<p align="justify">
	On November 17, 2008, the Department of Labor published final regulations governing the Family
	and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). The regulations will be effective January 16, 2009. Because the
	regulations are so extensive, the November issue of our bulletin only addressed the military family
	leave portion of the regulations and other aspects are covered in this bulletin.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Employer Obligation for FMLA Notices and Information.</b> The new rules clarify, simplify
	and in many cases ease the timely-notice requirement on employers from two days to five.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<i>General Notice.</i> The regulations include a prototype general notice, to be included in employee
	handbooks or other written materials concerning benefits and leave. If no such materials exist,
	the employer must provide the general notice to all new employees, but annual distribution to all
	employees is not required. The general notice must be posted where it's accessible to all
	employees and applicants. Electronic postings on the internet or an intranet are acceptable, but if
	any employees or applicants lack computer access, the employer must post a paper copy where it
	can be readily seen.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<i>Eligibility Notice</i> ñ addressing whether the employee meets the statutory eligibility criteria.
	Notification need not exhaustively address all reasons why an employee might not qualify for
	FMLA leave, only one potential reason must be given. Employers now have five business days
	to provide the eligibility notice.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<i>Notice of Rights and Responsibilities</i> ñ must be provided at the same time the eligibility notice is
	provided. The rules permit electronic distribution of the notice of rights and responsibilities, if
	the employer can demonstrate that the employee (who may already be on leave and who may not
	have access to employer-provided computers) has access to the information electronically.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<i>"Designation" Notice.</i> Employers have five business days (absent extenuating circumstances) to
	notify employees whether a leave will be designated as FMLA leave. The clock starts on those
	five days when the employer has sufficient information to determine whether the leave is being
	taken for an FMLA-qualifying reason. Only one designation notice is required for each FMLAqualifying
	reason per leave year, whether the leave is taken as a continuous block or on an
	intermittent basis. The regulations include a prototype designation notice.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<i>Fitness for Duty.</i> An employer can choose to accept a simple statement of fitness for duty, or not
	require certification at all. An employer may require that a fitness for duty certification address
	the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of his/her position. The employer must
	provide the employee with a list of the essential job functions no later than when the designation
	notice is provided, and the employer must indicate in the designation notice that the certification
	must address the employee's ability to perform those essential functions. The model notice has
	been modified to reflect this.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	While employers must set forth the essential functions of an employee's position if they wish to
	require a fitness for duty certification addressing those functions, there is no legal requirement
	under the FMLA that employers have pre-existing written or formal job descriptions for all
	positions. Such a requirement may exist in state laws, however.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<b>Contacting Health Care Providers.</b> The rule modifies the process by which an employer may
	contact an employee's health care provider to clarify that the employer representative contacting
	the employee's health care provider must be either a health care practitioner, a human resources
	professional, a leave administrator or a management official, but in no case may the employee's
	direct supervisor be the point of contact. Third parties may be used for the purposes of
	authenticating or clarifying FMLA certifications.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<b>Negotiating Claim Closure.</b> The old rule stated employees "cannot waive, nor may employers
	induce employees to waive, their rights under FMLA." The new rules make a distinction
	between prospective waiver (illegal) and retroactive waiver allowed to close an FMLA claim
	and accept severance or separation pay.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<b>Light Duty.</b> An employee who voluntarily accepts a light-duty position retains the right to job
	restoration until the end of the 12-month period that the employer uses to calculate FMLA leave.
	Nothing prevents employers from offering light-duty positions for a finite period of time.
	Because the light-duty assignment is voluntary, either the employer or employee can end it at
	any time. If the employee is not able to return to his/her position (or an equivalent), the
	employee may use the remainder of his/her FMLA leave. After that, the employee has a right to
	restoration. If the employee is still unable to resume work, the employer is no longer obligated
	to restore the employee to the original position. At that point, the employer may permanently
	assign the employee to a different position or terminate the employee.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<b>Record Retention.</b> The rule requires employers to maintain copies of all written notices
	provided to employees pursuant to the FMLA for at least three years.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<b>Applicable Laws.</b> The rule clarifies that the Department of Labor administers and enforces the
	FMLA, while State and local government agencies administer and enforce the laws for which
	they are responsible. Employers must comply with all applicable laws. Where a State or local
	law applies concurrently with the FMLA, there is unfortunately no way for employers to avoid
	the administrative burden that each leave request is to be considered under more than one law.
