<strong>IRS Releases New Regulations on Section 125 Cafeteria Plans</strong>

<p align="justify">The IRS released new proposed Cafeteria Plan regulations on August 6, 2007, replacing earlier proposed regulations issued between 1984 and 2000.</p>

<p align="justify">The new proposed regulations reflect changes in tax law, including the change in the definition of dependent and the addition of adoption assistance, Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and qualified HSA distributions from health FSAs as qualified benefits. These regulations are generally proposed to apply for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2009.  However, provisions regarding the taxation of group-term life insurance in excess of $50,000 are effective as of August 3, 2007 and previously established effective dates applying to debit cards remain in force.</p>

<p align="justify">The new regulations also clarify many requirements pertaining to Section 125 plans. They reaffirm the general rule from prior proposed regulations that section 125 is the only way an employer can offer employees a choice between taxable and nontaxable benefits without the choice itself resulting in a tax liability for the employees. Under the new proposed regulations, a plan is not a Cafeteria Plan unless it satisfies the requirements of section 125 and these regulations. Accordingly a plan could fail to satisfy the requirements if it </p>

<ul type="square">
<li>offers nonqualified benefits;</li>
<li>does not offer an election between at least one permitted taxable benefit and at least one qualified benefit; </li>
<li>defers compensation; </li>
<li>fails to comply with the uniform coverage rule or use-or-lose rule; </li>
<li>allows employees to revoke or make new elections during the plan year except as permitted by these regulations; </li>
<li>fails to comply with the substantiation requirements;</li>
<li>pays or reimburses expenses incurred before the plan’s effective date or before a period of coverage; </li>
<li>allocates experience gains (forfeitures) other than as expressly allowed in the new proposed regulations; or </li>
<li>fails to comply with grace period rules.</li></ul>

<p align="justify">The proposed regulations require the “written plan” or plan document to describe all benefits, explain the rules for eligibility, stipulate that all elections are irrevocable (except in the case of HSAs, as noted below), state how employer contributions may be made, identify the maximum amount of elective contributions, identify the plan year and include provisions that comply with the uniform coverage and use-or-lose rules, if the plan includes a flexible spending arrangement. The plan document must also state that only employees can participate, and that all plan provisions must apply to all employees uniformly. </p> 

<p align="justify">The regulations require that a plan year be 12 consecutive months and permit plan year changes and short plan years only for valid business purposes.  They also clarify that self-employed individuals (including sole proprietors, partners and directors) and more-than-2% shareholders of Subchapter S corporations can't participate in cafeteria plans.</p>  

<p align="justify">The regulations contain some new rules regarding the operation of the cafeteria plan.  One is that employers can give new employees 30 days to make a cafeteria plan election that is then effective as of the hire date (though salary reductions must come from future compensation that isn't "currently available" when the election is made). This is particularly helpful for those employers with date of hire coverage.</p>

<p align="justify">The regulations permit default elections between qualified benefits and taxable benefits for new or current employees who fail to make timely elections (e.g., a previous year's election could be continued unless changed), if certain procedures are followed.</p> 

<p align="justify">The regulations also permit employees who cease participating in a dependent care spending account plan (e.g., because of termination) to be reimbursed from unused DCAP benefits for eligible dependent care expenses incurred during the remainder of the plan year.</p>

<p align="justify">The saga of debit cards for health care flexible spending accounts continues, with the new rules requiring debit card programs to automatically cancel the debit cards when employees cease to participate in the health FSA. (Under debit card programs approved in prior guidance, cards were canceled at termination of employment; the new proposed regulations appear to allow card use by COBRA qualified beneficiaries.) The regulations make clear that it is the employers who must ensure that any inventory information approval system (IIAS) used under their card programs complies with applicable substantiation, reimbursement, and record keeping requirements.</p> 

<p align="justify">In addition to meeting general substantiation requirements, third-party substantiation is now required for participants in post-deductible health FSAs (that the HDHP deductible has been satisfied) and for participants in limited-purpose health FSAs (that the expenses are for eligible dental, vision, or preventive care).</p>

<p align="justify">The new regulations also permit cafeteria plans to provide a grace period every year.</p>  

<p align="justify">The new regulations also change the way the tax liability for group-term life insurance benefits in excess of $50,000 are calculated. Rather than requiring employees to include either the greater of the Table I cost of GTL exceeding $50,000, or the sum of salary reductions and flex credits used to pay for excess life insurance, the new regulations include the Table I amount in gross income, but allow for the sum of salary reduction and employer flex-credits to be excluded from income.</p>  

<p align="justify">The proposed regulations also permit employees to change, elect or revoke salary reduction elections for HSA contributions at any time in the plan year, as long as the change is prospective, not retrospective.</p> 
 
<p align="justify">New definitions of key terms, including “highly compensated individual or participant,” “officer,” “five percent shareholder” and “key employee” clarify the application of nondiscrimination rules. In addition, the regulations provide an objective nondiscrimination test to determine when the actual election of benefits is discriminatory. The regulations also provide a safe harbor for health benefits and premium only plans.</p>
