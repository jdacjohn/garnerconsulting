	<p><b>EEOC ISSUES ADAAA REGULATIONS</b></p>

	<p>On September 23, 2009, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) published proposed regulations in the 
		Federal Register to implement the equal employment provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as 
		amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008.  The EEOC also published questions and answers about the 
		proposed regulations.
	</p>
	<p>The proposed regulations provide that the definition of "disability" shall be interpreted broadly and 
		revise the portion of the regulations defining the term "substantially limits" by providing that a limitation need not "significantly" or "severely" restrict a major life activity.  The proposed changes to the regulations also delete reference to the terms "condition, manner or duration" under which a major life activity is performed.
	</p>
	<p>The proposed regulations expand the definition of "major life activities" through two non-exhaustive lists.  The first list includes activities such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, interacting with others and working.  The second list includes major bodily functions, such as functions of the immune system, special sense organs and skin, normal cell growth and digestive, genitourinary, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, cardiovascular, endocrine, hemic, lymphatic, musculoskeletal and reproductive functions.
	</p>
	<p>The proposed rule also provides that the definition of "regarded as" is changed so that it no longer requires a showing that the employer perceived the individual to be substantially limited in a major life activity and instead provides that an applicant or employee who is subjected to an action prohibited by the ADA (such as a failure to hire, denial of promotion or termination) because of an actual or perceived impairment will meet the "regarded as" definition of disability, unless the impairment is both transitory and minor.
	</p>
	<p>The proposed regulations also provide that actions based on an impairment include actions based on 
		symptoms of an impairment and the EEOC invites public comment on this point.  Furthermore, 
		the proposed rules provide that qualification standards, employment tests or other selection 
		criteria based on an individual's uncorrected vision shall not be used unless shown to be 
		job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.

	<p>There is a 60-day comment period.</p>



	<p><b>AGENCIES ISSUE INTERIM RULES UNDER GINA </b></p>

	<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue 
		Service have released an interim final rule prohibiting discrimination on the basis of an individual's genetic information under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA).  This rule, published in the Federal Register on October 7, 2009, will be effective for group health plans with plan years beginning on or after December 7, 2009.  For calendar year plans the effective date will be January 1, 2010.  For coverage in the individual market the rule will be effective December 7, 2009.
	</p>
	<p>This rule will prohibit group health plans and health insurers from using genetic information to:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Set group premiums based on that information;</li>
	<li>Deny enrollment or otherwise condition eligibility for benefits on that information;</li>
	<li>Impose preexisting condition exclusions; and</li>
	<li>Engage in underwriting practices using that information.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Also under this rule, group health plans and health insurers may not request, require, or purchase genetic information to use in the underwriting process or in connection with enrollment in a plan, nor may plans or insurers ask or require individuals to submit to genetic testing.  Prohibited uses of genetic information include collecting genetic information in the form of a family medical history prior to enrollment, as well as basing rewards for wellness programs on health risk assessments (HRAs) that request genetic information in the form of family medical history.  Similar prohibitions apply to individual insurance.
	</p>
	<p>This means that employers cannot ask employees to complete HRAs prior to employment if the HRAs ask questions about family history (most current HRAs do ask about family history).  It also means that employers cannot base any financial penalties or rewards on HRAs if the HRAs ask any questions about family history.  Some employers will need to act quickly to modify their HRAs, their financial incentives and/or their procedures before the effective date.
	</p>
	<p>HHS has also issued a proposed rule under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) modifying provisions of the Privacy Rule.  The proposed rule revises or adds various definitions to the Privacy Rule, clarifies that genetic information is protected health information for purposes of HIPAA and imposes prohibitions similar to those described above under GINA.  The proposed rule also prohibits the use and disclosure of genetic information for underwriting purposes, even if the individual has signed an authorization and revises the content of the notice of privacy practices to include a statement to this effect if a group health plan performs underwriting functions.
	</p>
	<p>This proposed rule will be effective 180 days after it is finalized.  Because of the American 
		Recovery and Reinvestment Act's recent changes to the penalties that may be imposed for 
		violations of the Privacy Rule, under this latest proposed rule improper use or disclosure 
		of genetic information could result in a fine ranging from $100 to $50,000 per violation.
	</p>

		<p><b>HEALTH CARE REFORM UPDATE</b></p>
	<p>On October 13, 2009, the Senate Finance Committee passed its version of health care reform.  Now that all five committees with jurisdiction over health care reform have passed legislation, it is up to the leadership in each house of Congress to merge the bills in that house for action on the floor of the house, where there will undoubtedly be many amendments.</p>

		<p>The bill in the Senate Finance Committee, written by chairman Max Baucus (D-MT) has yet to gather any
		support from Republicans. Now that the late Senator Kennedy (D-MA) has been replaced, Democrats
		and their independent allies in the Senate control 60 votes, so Republican support would not be needed to
		pass a bill, if Senator Byrd (D-WV) is healthy enough to vote. Even though the Democrats may have the
		votes needed to pass a bill, the President has repeatedly stated his preference for a bipartisan measure.</p>
