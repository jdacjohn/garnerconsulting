<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">
The following is a brief summary of some of the new laws affecting life, health and disability
insurance in California. Unless otherwise noted, the bills described here apply to contracts issued,
amended, delivered or renewed on or after January 1, 2009.
</p>

<p><i><b>Post Stabilization Care</b></i></p>
<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">
AB 1203 prohibits a non-contracting hospital from billing a patient for post-stabilization care, except for
applicable copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles, unless the patient assumes financial responsibility
for the care, or the hospital is unable to obtain the HMO's name and contact information. The bill's terms
describe the attempts that must be made to contact the plan before care is provided, and outlines the type
of information that must be exchanged. In addition, the bill specifically requires that an HMO, or its
contracting medical providers, provide 24-hour access for non-contracting hospitals to obtain timely
authorization for post-stabilization care. The terms of the bill do not apply to minor treatment procedures
if certain conditions apply.
</p>
<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">
Another part of the bill defines when a patient is "stabilized." When a patient is stabilized, a patient can
be moved to a network facility. AB 1203 states that a patient is "stabilized" or "stabilization" has
occurred when, in the opinion of the treating provider, no material deterioration of the patient's condition
is likely to result from, or occur during, the release of the patient.
</p>

<p><i><b>HIV Testing</b></i></p>
<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">
AB 1894 requires HMOs and health insurers issuing individual or group contracts or policies, on or after
January 1, 2009, to provide testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) regardless of whether the
testing is related to a primary diagnosis. The section applicable to insurance policies adds the following:
"It shall remain within the sole discretion of the health insurer as to the provider of the testing with which
it chooses to contract. Reimbursement shall be provided according to the respective principles and
policies of the health insurer."
</p>

<p><b><i>Dependent Children</i></b></p>
<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">
SB 1168 provides that if an HMO or insurance policy provides coverage for a dependent child who is
over 18 years of age and enrolled full-time at a secondary or post-secondary educational institution, that
coverage shall not terminate, for a period not to exceed 12 months or until the date on which the coverage
is scheduled to terminate pursuant to the terms and conditions of the policy, whichever comes first, if the
dependent child takes a medical leave of absence from school. Certification of the need for the leave
must be provided within specified time periods.
</p>
<p><b><i>Long-Term Care Insurance</i></b></p>
<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">
SB 1216 provides that, as to long-term care claims accepted on or after December 1, 2008, interest shall
accrue and shall be payable to the claimant at the rate of 10% per annum on the amount of any accepted
claim, beginning on the first calendar day after payment of the accepted claim is due. The bill applies to
any claim accepted after December 1, 2008.
</p>

<p><b><i>Dental Coverage: Provider Overpayments</i></b></p>
<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">
SB 1387 requires that an overpayment notice sent by a dental plan or insurer contain specified
information. The notice of overpayment shall inform the dentist how to access the insurer's dispute
resolution mechanism, along with relevant contact information. The notice shall also contain a statement
that a provider is required to reimburse the insurer for an overpayment within 30 working days of receipt
by the provider of the notice of overpayment unless the provider contests the overpayment within 30
working days. The notice shall also include information clearly identifying the claim, the name of the
patient, the date of service, and a clear explanation of the basis upon which the insurer believes the
amount paid on the claim was in excess of the amount due, including interest and penalties on the claim.
The notice shall also include a statement that if the provider does not make reimbursement of an
uncontested overpayment within 30 working days after receipt of the notice, interest shall accrue at a rate
of 10 % per annum.
</p>

<p><b><i>Mental Health Service</i></b></p>
<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">
SB 1553 prohibits an HMO from basing decisions to deny requests by providers for authorization or to
deny claim reimbursement on whether or not an admission was voluntary or the method of transportation
to the health care facility. The bill also requires a plan that provides coverage for professional mental
health services to include information on its website that will assist subscribers and enrollees in accessing
mental health services.
</p>

<p><b><i>San Francisco Commuter Benefits Ordinance</i></b></p>
<p style="word-spacing:-1" align="justify">
Effective January 19, 2009, employers must provide San Francisco-based employees with commuter
benefits. The new ordinance applies to employers with 20 or more employees. In counting the number of
employees, employers must include all those who work full-time, part-time, or on a temporary basis, even
those who work outside San Francisco. The benefit must only be extended to employees who work at
least 10 hours a week within the geographic boundaries of San Francisco. Employers must provide
employees with the option to make a pre-tax election under an IRC section 132(f) plan, an employer paid
transit benefit (such as through the purchase of transit passes), or employer provided transit (such as a van
pool). More information may be found at <a href="http://www.commuterbenefits.org/"
