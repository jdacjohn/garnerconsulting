	<strong>AGENCIES ISSUE REGULATIONS ON PREVENTIVE SERVICES</strong>

	<p>On Monday, July 19, 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) along with the IRS
	and the Employee Benefits Security Administration released interim final rules relating to coverage of
	preventive services under the Affordable Care Act.</p>
	<p>These rules require health plans (including Medicare and Medicaid) and health insurance issuers to
	cover recommended preventive services without imposing cost-sharing requirements in the form of
	deductibles, co-insurance or co-payments when preventive services are delivered by a network
	provider. Plans will still be able to impose these cost-sharing requirements on preventive services
	delivered by a non-network provider. These rules will take effect for plan years beginning on or after
	September 23, 2010 (with the exception of grandfathered plans).</p>
	<p>The proposed rules will apply to four categories of preventive services:</p>

	<ol>
	<li>		Evidence-based services rated A or B under current recommendations of the U.S. Preventive
		Services Task Force. This means that screenings for breast and colon cancer, diabetes, high
		blood pressure and high cholesterol will be covered, as well as tobacco cessation counseling.</li>
	<li>	Routine immunizations for children, adolescents and adults recommended by the Advisory
		Committee on Immunization Practices. This includes routine childhood vaccinations as well as
		periodic tetanus shots for adults.</li>
	<li>	Evidence-informed preventive care and screenings for infants, children and adolescents. This
		includes regular pediatrician visits, vision and hearing screening, developmental assessments,
		immunizations and obesity screening and counseling.</li>
	<li>	Evidence-informed preventive care and screenings for women. HHS is expected to issue
		guidelines for this category of preventive care soon.</li>

	</ol>

	<p>As new guidelines and recommendations for preventive care are developed, health plans and health
	insurance issuers will have to cover them without imposing cost-sharing requirements beginning with
	the plan year that is one year after the date of the publication of the guideline or recommendation.</p>
	The issuing agencies estimate that the effect of these rules will be to increase premiums by about
	1.5% on average.

	<p><strong>AGENCIES ISSUE REGULATIONS ON CLAIMS AND APPEALS</strong></p>

	<p>On Friday, July 23, 2010, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and the Treasury
	released interim final regulations implementing the enhanced internal claims and appeals and external
	review processes under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. These regulations will
	generally affect health insurance issuers, group health plans and participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees in health insurance coverage and group health plans, and are effective for plan or policy
	years beginning on or after September 23, 2010.</p>

	<p>The regulations have broad applicability. The IRS regulations affect private-sector and church group
	health plans and insurers; the DOL regulations apply to ERISA plans and their insurers; and the HHS
	regulations apply to governmental plans and insurers operating in the group and individual markets
	under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Compliance responsibilities vary for insured and selfinsured
	plans. Self-insured plans under ERISA must comply with all of the rules, while insured plans
	or their insurers must comply with the internal claims and appeal rules. The insurer remains
	responsible for complying with the external review requirements. However, grandfathered plans and
	plans providing "excepted" benefits under HIPAA are not required to comply. "Excepted" benefits
	include most health FSAs, some HRAs and limited scope dental and vision plans.</p>

	<p>The effect of these new regulations is to extend the application of existing DOL claims procedure
	regulations to non-ERISA governmental and church group plans. These regulations also enhance
	existing DOL regulations by expanding the definition of "adverse benefit determination" to include
	rescissions of coverage; shortening the deadline for making urgent care determinations from 72 hours
	to 24 hours; adding criteria that spell out what constitutes a "full and fair review" including giving
	claimants the opportunity to present evidence and testimony and to give claimants sufficient time to
	review and respond to any new evidence adduced by the insurer or plan; adding criteria to avoid
	conflicts of interest in the selection of persons to conduct the claims review; expanding the content
	that must be included in any benefits denial notice; permitting a claimant to go to court without
	exhausting the plan's internal review and appeal procedures if the plan or insurer fails to "strictly
	adhere" to the new requirements; allowing claimants to obtain a review of a "final internal adverse
	benefit determination" by an "independent review organization" (IRO); extending federal external
	review procedures to self-insured group health plans and insurers that are not subject to state
	regulation; and requiring the provision of notices describing the claims review and appeal rules in a
	"culturally and linguistically appropriate manner" if the plan covers a specified minimum number of
	participants who are literate in the same non-English language. This last provision goes substantially
	beyond current ERISA requirements which only require that "assistance" be provided to non-English
	readers. Under the new regulations, relevant notices will have to be translated into the appropriate
	language upon request and once translated, all subsequent notices to the claimants must also be
	translated.</p>

	<p><strong>HEALTH CARE REFORM MAY EXTEND LIFE OF MEDICARE</strong></p>

	<p>Each year the Trustees of the Medicare trust fund report in detail on its financial condition. The
	financial status of the trust fund is substantially improved by the lower expenditures and additional
	tax revenues instituted by the Affordable Care Act. These changes are estimated to postpone the
	exhaustion of hospital insurance trust fund assets from 2017 under the prior law to 2029 under current
	law. Many critics argue that these savings are illusory because Congress is likely to make changes in
	the future; however, the Trustees are obligated to make their calculations based on current law.</p>
	The release of this report was delayed from its normal schedule to allow incorporation of the effects
	of the health care reform legislation, which contained roughly 165 provisions affecting Medicare.
