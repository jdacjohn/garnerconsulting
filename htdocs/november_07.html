<strong>SCHWARZENEGGER, DEMS STALL ON HEALTH CARE COMPROMISE BILL</strong>

<p align="justify">Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez and Senate President pro Tem Don Perata released a new Democratic health care proposal on November 6, as their "last and final" offer to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.  The new bill remains close to the basic principles of AB 8, the Democratic plan vetoed by the Governor last month, while meeting Schwarzenegger halfway on other elements of his plan.  </p>

<p align="justify">The new bill calls for universal coverage, covering more Californians than the original Democratic plan.  That means it will cost more, and the Democratic leaders propose putting a $2-per-pack cigarette tax on next year's ballot to help fund the program.  Nunez and Perata also have cut their fee on employers from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent and reducing it to just 2 percent for companies with the smallest payrolls.  That makes it more like Schwarzenegger's sliding scale, though the Governor's scale, at 0% to 4%, is still lower.  </p>


<p align="justify">The Governor has proposed using the California Lottery as a source of financing, and either his plan, or the Democrats' $2-per-pack tax would raise about the same amount of money.  Nunez and Perata have not compromised on requiring bulk purchasing of pharmaceuticals as well as transparency from hospitals, and those two elements are expected to be non-negotiable. Schwarzenegger is on the other side on both issues. The new bill also contains a variety of cost-containment positions while adding some of Schwarzenegger's preventive treatment provisions. </p>

<p align="justify">All of the financing provisions would be put on the November 2008 ballot by initiative. To get that process going, the Legislature will need to act by the end of the month on the policy aspects of the bill. </p>

<p align="justify">Unfortunately, that doesn't look likely.  The Assembly was expected to vote on ABx11, the compromise version of the bill, but voting was postponed by Nunez right after the Thanksgiving break.  Stating that there were still details to negotiate, the Speaker told Democrats to expect to return to Sacramento for the vote in early December.  The Governor summoned Nunez and other negotiators to the capitol to continue talks.  </p>


<p align="justify">One wrench in the works is that now the Legislature has missed the deadline to get the initiative for the funding of health care reform on the ballot for February 2008, but could still make it for June or November.  </p>


<strong>CIRCUIT COURT SAYS NO CONVICTION NECESSARY FOR FELONY EXCLUSION</strong>

<p align="justify">The 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals has weighed in on yet another angle of the debate over whether intoxication invalidates claims under accidental death and dismemberment policies.  In the case of Steele v. Life Insurance Co. of North America, which was decided on November 7, the insurance company denied the accidental death claim under the policy's felony exclusion.  Because the deceased died while driving under the influence of alcohol, and had previously been convicted of two DUIs, the company stated that he died while committing a felony.  </p>


<p align="justify">The deceased's widow, Laura Steele, claimed that the exclusion should not apply because her husband wasn't actually convicted of the third DUI, and a prosecutor had stated that he would not have charged the deceased with a felony.  The law in the State of Illinois, however, is clear that a third conviction for driving while intoxicated is a felony conviction, and the court rejected the argument that an actual conviction is necessary to establish that the situation constituted a felony.  The court also said, with respect to the prosecutor's statement, that an insurance company should not have to depend on the state's success in prosecuting a crime in order to enforce a felony exclusion.  </p>

<strong>IRS RELEASES MILEAGE AMOUNTS FOR 2008</strong>

<p align="justify">The IRS announced on November 27 that the new reimbursement amount for miles driven for business purposes will be 50.5 cents, up from 48.5 cents in 2007.  Miles driven for medical or moving purposes, however, are reimbursable at only 19 cents, down a penny from 20 cents in 2007.  Miles driven for charitable purposes will be reimbursable at 14 cents per mile.  </p>

<strong>DEADLINE FOR ELECTRONIC 5500 FILING PUSHED BACK TO 2009</strong>

<p align="justify">The Department of Labor announced on November 15 that revisions to the Form 5500 include a one-year deferral of the Department's move to an entirely electronic filing system.  Plans and providers will not be required to comply with the changes or the move to electronic filing until the due date for the plan's 2009 form.  </p>

<p align="justify">The changes also include annual reporting changes required by the Pension Protection Act, which will be incorporated into the 2008 forms (as required by the law) so that they can still be filed on paper.  Other changes and technical improvements were also included in the revisions, which were published on November 16.  </p>

<strong>CONGRESS PASSES PROTECTION AGAINST SEXUAL ORIENTATION DISCRIMINATION </strong>

<p align="justify">On November 8 the US House of Representatives passed a law against workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation.  Senator Ted Kennedy stated that he will introduce a Senate version of the bill, with Republican Senator Susan Collins co-sponsoring.  </p>


<p align="justify">The bill expands federal law against discrimination, adding sexual orientation to the list of race, religion, ethnicity, sex, age, disability and pregnancy.  The law does not currently protect transsexuals, however, and House Democrats, including Barney Frank, an openly gay representative from Massachusetts, removed language that would have done so when it seemed it might threaten the bill's passage.  </p>


<strong>NEW FORM FOR EMPLOYERS TO CONFIRM WORK AUTHORIZATION</strong>

<p align="justify">The Department of Homeland Security has released a new form for employers to use in making sure that new hires have work authorization for the US.  The new form I-9 will not bet required until the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) publishes regulations for its implementation.  Also, the USCIS will no longer accept Certificates of US Citizenship or Naturalization, greencards, reentry permits, or refugee travel documents as proof of employment eligibility.  </p>
